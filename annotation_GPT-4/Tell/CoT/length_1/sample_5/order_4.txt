Question: Where does Hannah think Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is?
Answer: blue_drawer
Choices: A. green_treasure_chest, B. green_bottle, C. green_drawer, D. green_envelope, E. red_bottle, F. red_box, G. blue_crate, H. red_envelope, I. red_drawer, J. red_container, K. blue_treasure_chest, L. blue_drawer, M. blue_pantry, N. red_crate, O. red_bucket

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: blue_drawer
GPT-4 Answer: red_crate
GPT-4 Explain: Answer: N. red_crate

Explanation: 
Step 1: Sophia publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate (line 16). 
Step 2: Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer (line 17). 
Step 3: Since Hannah trusts Logan more (as he exited the garage later), she believes the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. 
Step 4: However, Elizabeth doesn't know about the private conversation between Logan and Hannah. She only knows about Sophia's public claim. 
Step 5: So, Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks the asparagus is in the red_crate. 
Step 6: Hannah knows that Elizabeth was present when Sophia made the public claim, so she thinks Elizabeth believes Sophia's claim. 
Step 7: Therefore, Hannah thinks Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is in the red_crate (N).
