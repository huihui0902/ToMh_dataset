Question: Where does Owen think Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is?
Answer: red_bottle
Choices: A. red_drawer, B. red_bucket, C. blue_drawer, D. green_crate, E. blue_treasure_chest, F. green_drawer, G. green_bucket, H. red_pantry, I. green_envelope, J. blue_pantry, K. red_bottle, L. red_container, M. blue_crate, N. green_box, O. red_basket

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: red_bottle
GPT-4 Answer: red_bottle
GPT-4 Explain: Answer: K. red_bottle

Explanation: Owen exited the front_yard after step 4, so he didn't see Logan move the tangerine to the green_box in step 5. Therefore, Owen thinks the tangerine is still in the red_bottle. Since Owen and Logan didn't have any interactions after that, Owen has no reason to believe that Logan's belief about the tangerine's location has changed. Thus, Owen thinks Logan thinks the tangerine is in the red_bottle. Similarly, Logan and Ava didn't have any interactions after Logan exited the front_yard, so Owen thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_bottle as well.
