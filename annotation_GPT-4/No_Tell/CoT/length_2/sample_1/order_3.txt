Question: Where does Charlotte think Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the cucumber is?
Answer: green_treasure_chest
Choices: A. green_pantry, B. red_drawer, C. green_cupboard, D. green_envelope, E. blue_treasure_chest, F. red_envelope, G. green_treasure_chest, H. blue_drawer, I. red_crate, J. green_bottle, K. green_basket, L. red_pantry, M. blue_cupboard, N. green_box, O. red_bottle

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_treasure_chest
GPT-4 Answer: green_treasure_chest
GPT-4 Explain: Answer: F. red_envelope

Explanation: 
1. Charlotte knows the cucumber is in the red_crate because she moved it there (step 7).
2. Charlotte knows that Evelyn thinks the cucumber is in the red_envelope because Evelyn moved it there (step 5) and exited the dining_room before Charlotte moved the cucumber.
3. Charlotte knows that Ava was in the dining_room before Evelyn moved the cucumber, so she thinks Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the cucumber is in the green_treasure_chest (step 2). However, since Charlotte knows that agents tend to lie, she would assume that Ava thinks Evelyn is lying about the cucumber's location. Therefore, Charlotte thinks Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the cucumber is in the red_envelope (F).
