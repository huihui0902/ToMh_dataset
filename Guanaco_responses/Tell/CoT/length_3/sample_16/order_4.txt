### Assistant: 1. Ella believes Owen has not left the waiting room yet since she has not exited herself.
Ella knows that Owen has seen Noah claim that "the cherry is in the green envelope".
We know from assumption (3) that this means that Owen now believes that "the cherry is in the green envelope" as well.
2. We also know that Owen believes what he was originally told about where the cherry is. From earlier we know that Aiden had taken it out of the blue bucket and put it into the cupboard, so Owen would still believe that it was there at this time. This is because Owens last movement was entering the waiting room, which is after these events took place.
3. However, we also know that Aiden lied to Ella telling her the cherries were in fact in the blue treasure chest. From assumption (3), we know that lying does not change their own personal beliefs, but it will affect the beliefs of those listening. Since Aiden said this to Ella, who already believed that the cherries were in the blue bucket, Ella will update her own beliefs accordingly. So when she privately tells Aiden that the cherries are actually in the red box, she is lying again, but it is a lie built off of other lies. Aiden however will believe her anyways since he trusts people more the longer they stay in a room, even though it contradicts his own knowledge that the cherries were in the cupboard.
4. Now we come back around full circle to Ella who asked us where Owen thought the cherries were. She knows that Owen thinks they are in the green envelope, but also suspects that he may have updated his beliefs based on some of the information she provided. Unfortunately, due to her own lies, we don't really know how much Owen will have updated his beliefs! It could be that he has fully changed his mind and now believes that they are in the red box, or it could be that he has only partially shifted his opinion to say that they might be in either the green envelope or the red box. Without knowing exactly what Owen is thinking, we can't give you one definitive answer, so our best bet is to list them all out and let you pick the most likely option!
