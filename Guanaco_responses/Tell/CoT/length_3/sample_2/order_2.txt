Step 1: Break down the question into simpler parts:

Q1: Where does Owen think Aiden thinks the melon is?
Q2: Where does Aiden think the melon is?
Q3: Where does Owen think the melon is?

Step 2: Trace relevant agents' beliefs step by step:

T1: Before entering the back_yard, Owen knows nothing about the melon.
T2: After Ella moves the melon to the blue_bottle, Owen sees this movement and infers that the melon is now in the blue_bottle.
T3: After Ella exits the back_yard, Owen still believes that the melon is in the blue_bottle.
T4: After moving the melon to the green_envelope, Owen believes that the melon is now in the green_envelope.
T5: After exiting the back_yard, Owen continues to believe that the melon is in the green_envelope.
T6: After hearing from Isla that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest, Ella infers that the melon is not in the green_envelope anymore. She now believes that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest.
T7: After moving the melon to the blue_suitcase, Aiden believes that the melon is now in the blue_suitcase.
T8: After exiting the back_yard, Aiden continues to believe that the melon is in the blue_suitcase.
T9: After hearing from Owen that the melon is in the blue_suitcase, Aiden infers that the melon is indeed in the blue_suitcase. He has no reason to doubt what Owen said since Owen exited the back_yard after seeing Ella move the melon to the blue_suitcase.
T10: After hearing from Ella that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest, Owen infers that the melon is not in the blue_suitcase anymore. He now believes that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest.
