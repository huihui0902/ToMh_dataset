### Assistant: 1. "Where" is referring to the location of something. So we need to find where the spinach is located at first.  
2. From Step 4, the spinach was moved from the red_container to the green_crate.   
3. In Steps 8 and 18, both Ella and Jackson know that the spinach is in the red_crate. They are the only two people who knew this information.  
4. In Step 16, Jack lied about the spinach being in the red_drawer. He does not actually believe this because he did not enter the laundry after the spinach was moved there.   
5. In Step 21, Jacob also lied about knowing where the spinach is. He has never been in the laundry since it was moved there.    
6. Therefore, Jack believes the spinach is still in the red_crate. This is what he would tell Jackson.    
7. Since Jackson already knows the truth, he will not change his belief. He thinks the spinach is still in the red_crate as well.    
8. Jackson has never talked to Jacob directly. However, Jacob could have overheard their conversation. But even if he didn't hear them talking, he would just assume the spinach is still in the original container. That's where he last saw it!    
9. Jack's lie might make Jacob unsure of himself. But he still has more reason to trust his own memory than someone else's claim.  
10. Thus, we can conclude that Jackson thinks Jacob still thinks the spinach is in the red_crate.
