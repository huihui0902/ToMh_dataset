### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where the "peas" are located. There are several options listed, but we need to narrow it down to one answer.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:
Logan was the first person to enter the hallway, and he did not move anything. Then, Isabella moved the peas from the red bottle to the green bottle. Next, Hannah moved the peas from the green bottle to the blue treasure chest. Finally, Chloe moved the peas back to the red bottle.

3. Determine the last position of the item:
Based on our tracing, the most recent movement was done by Chloe, who moved the peas back to the red bottle. Therefore, the current location of the peas is the red bottle.

4. Output the answer:
The correct answer is A - red bottle
