### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where the apple is *really*. This implies that there may be some false information provided that could lead you astray. It also indicates that the correct answer will not necessarily match what has been said out loud.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:
Ella moves the apple from the green_pantry to the green_bottle.
Jack moves the apple from the green_bottle to the green_box.
Evelyn moves the apple from the green_box to the red_pantry.

3. Determine the last position of the apple:
Based on our tracing, we know that the most recent movement was Evelyn moving the apple from the green_box to the red_pantry. So the current location of the apple is the red_pantry.

4. Output the answer:
The apple is in the red_pantry
