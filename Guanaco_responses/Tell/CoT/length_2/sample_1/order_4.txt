### Assistant: 1. Break down the question into simpler parts:

* Where does Ella think...? - This part of the question asks about Ella's belief. We need to start from her perspective.
* ...the persimmon is? - This is what we are looking for. In this case, it's the "persimmon".
* ...Owen thinks...? - Now we need to find out what Owen believes. But notice that we don't start from Owen's perspective directly. Instead, we look at what Ella thinks Owen thinks.
* ...Amelia thinks...? - Next, we need to find out what Amelia believes. Again, we don't start from Amelia's perspective directly. Rather, we look at what Ella thinks Amelia thinks.
* ...the persimmon is? - Finally, we reach the end of the chain. We now know what Ella thinks Owen thinks Amelia thinks the persimmon is.
