### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where the tomato is *really*. This implies there are false statements about its location, so we need to identify those and discount them from our consideration. We also know that the tomato was originally in the red container, but this may not still be true after subsequent events.

2. Trace relevant movements step by step:
Emma saw a cat - irrelevant as it does not mention the tomato.
Liam moved the tomato to the green drawer - this is the most recent event involving the tomato, so we should focus on this.
Nathan publicly claimed the tomato was in the blue bottle - this is a false statement, as per assumption (3). We can ignore this claim.
Carter privately told Emma the tomato was in the green drawer - this is a more reliable source, as per assumptions (2) & (4), since Carter has just left the study and is telling Emma directly.

3. Determine the last position of the tomato:
Based on these steps, we can conclude that the tomato is currently in the green drawer, as per Liam's action.

4. Output answer:
Therefore, the correct answer is "N" - the tomato is in the green drawer.
