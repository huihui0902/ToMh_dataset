### Assistant: 1. Break down the question: "Where is the peach really?" means we need to find out where the peach actually is, not just where someone has claimed it to be.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:

Hannah made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute. -> She did not move the peach.
Liam moved the peach to the blue_treasure_chest. -> He moved the peach from its previous location to the blue_treasure_chest.
Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute. -> He did not move the peach.
Avery made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute. -> She did not move the peach.
Mila made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute. -> She did not move the peach.
Hannah, Liam, Benjamin, Avery and Mila entered the waiting_room. -> They are now in a different room, so none of them could have moved the peach after this point.
Liam lost his gloves. -> This event does not involve the peach.
Benjamin privately told Hannah that the peach is in the red_envelope. -> Benjamin believes the peach is in the red_envelope, but he didn't move it there himself.
Liam privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle. -> Liam believes the peach is in the red_bottle, but again, he didn't move it there himself.
Based on these steps, we can conclude that the most recent movement of the peach was when Liam moved it to the blue_treasure_chest. So the last known location of the peach is the blue_treasure_chest.

3. Use our trace to determine the last position of the peach: Based on our tracing of the relevant movements, we know that the last time the peach was moved was when Liam put it in the blue_treasure_chest. Therefore, the last known position of the peach is the blue_treasure_chest.

4. Output our answer: The last known position of the peach is the blue_treasure_chest.
