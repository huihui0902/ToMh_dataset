### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where the tangerine is *really*. This implies there are false statements about its location. We need to find the most recent true statement about the tangerine's location.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:
Mila moves the tangerine from the green treasure chest to the blue crate.
Chloe lies to Benjamin saying the tangerine is still in the green treasure chest.
Benjamin moves the tangerine from the green treasure chest to the blue pantry.
Elizabeth moves the tangerine back to the green treasure chest.
Amelia privately tells Mila that the tangerine is in the red box. However, this is not considered a true statement as it was said after Elizabeth had already moved the tangerine back to the green treasure chest.

3. Determine the last position of the tangerine:
Based on our tracing, we know that the latest true statement about the tangerine's location comes from Elizabeth who says it is in the green treasure chest. Therefore, we can conclude that the tangerine is currently located in the green treasure chest.

4. Output the answer:
The tangerine is in the green treasure chest
