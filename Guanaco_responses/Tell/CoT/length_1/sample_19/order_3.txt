### Assistant: 1. Break down the question into simpler parts:

Q1: Where does Ella think the green pepper is?
Q2: Where does Lily think the green pepper is?
Q3: Where does Logan think the green peeper is?

2. Trace relevant agents' beliefs step by step:

Ella:
P1: Entered the den, saw nothing related to the green pepper.
P2: Saw Logan moving the green pepper to the blue crate.
P3: Exited the den without any further information.
Lily:
P1: Entered the den after Ella, saw Ella making no movement.
P2: Saw nothing else related to the green pepper.
P3: Exited the den without any further information.
Logan:
P1: Entered the den after Lily, saw Lily making no movement.
P2: Moved the green pepper to the blue crate.
P3: Exited the den without any further information.

3. Apply the assumptions to your trace:

Based on the assumptions, we know that:
Agents can only infer other agents' beliefs if they have been in the same place or had private/public conversations.
Elizabeth has more up-to-date knowledge about where the green pepper is since she exited the den last.
Ella knows that Logan moved the green pepper to the blue crate because she saw this happen in P2.
Lily has less up-to-date knowledge about where the green pepper is compared to Ella because she exited the den earlier.

4. Output your answer:

Based on our analysis, we can conclude that:
Ella thinks that Logan thinks the green pepper is in the blue crate (Answer Q3).
Ella thinks that Lily thinks the green pepper is still in the red drawer (Answer Q2), which is incorrect.
Elizabeth knows that the green pepper is actually in the blue crate (Answer Q1)
