### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify what information is being asked about. In this case, the question asks where the lemon is located after all the events described in the story.

2. To trace the relevant movements step by step, we need to start from the beginning of the story and follow each event carefully. Here are the key steps related to the lemon:

Jack moved the lemon to the blue_pantry (Step 3).
Liam moved the lemon to the blue_crate (Step 5).
Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket (Step 7).
Sophia made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute (Steps 9-10).
Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer (Step 11).

3. Using our trace of the relevant movements, we can determine that the last position of the lemon was in the green_drawer when Nathan moved it there in Step 11. This is the most recent movement involving the lemon, so we can conclude that the lemon is currently located in the green_drawer.

4. My answer is that the lemon is located in the green_drawer
