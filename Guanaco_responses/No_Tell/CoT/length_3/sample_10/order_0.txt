### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify which part of the story relates to the sweet potato. We can see from the story that the sweet potato was initially in the red container, but after several movements, its final location is not clear. So, we need to carefully trace back each movement involving the sweet potato.

2. Here are the relevant movements related to the sweet potato:

* Ava moved the sweet potato to the blue cupboard (Step 6).
* Charlotte moved the sweet potato to the green drawer (Step 10).
* William moved the sweet potato back to the red container (Step 12).

3. Based on these movements, we can conclude that the last known location of the sweet potato is the red container, as per Step 12. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "Where is the sweet potato really?" is option F - red container
