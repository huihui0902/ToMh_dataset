### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify what information is being asked about. In this case, the question asks where the "peas" are located.

2. We can start tracing the movements related to the peas from the beginning of the story:

* Step 1: Mila moves the peas to the blue bucket.
* Step 5: Carter moves the peas back to the green bucket.
* Step 10: Amelia moves the peas to the blue cupboard.

Based on these steps, we know that the most recent movement involving the peas was when Amelia moved them to the blue cupboard. So, our next step is to determine whether any subsequent events might have changed this.

3. After step 10, there are several other movements mentioned in the story, but none of them involve the peas. Therefore, we can conclude that the most up-to-date location of the peas is still the blue cupboard.

4. Answer: Based on my analysis, the correct answer to the question "Where is the peas really?" is option E - "blue cupboard"
