### Assistant: 1. Break down the question: "Where is the apple?" means we need to find out where the apple was located at the end of the story.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:

* Step 1: Hannah moves the apple from the green bathtub to the blue cupboard.
* Step 2: Jack moves the apple from the green drawer to the green box.
* Step 3: Lily moves the apple from the green box to the red crate.
* Step 4: Hannah likes the blue drawer. This does not move the apple anywhere.
* Step 5: Logan stays in the closet for one minute without moving anything.
* Step 6: Aiden also stays in the closet for one minute without moving anything.
* Step 7: Hannah, Jack, Lily, Logan, and Aiden enter the waiting room. No movement happens here.

3. Determine the last position of the apple: Based on our tracing, the last movement of the apple happened when Lily moved it to the red crate. So, the final location of the apple is the red crate.

4. Output the answer: The correct answer is option N - red_box
