### Assistant: 1. Break down the question: "Where is the carrot?" means we need to find out where the carrot was placed at the end of the story.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:

* Step 1: Isabella moves the carrot from the red_container to the blue_container.
* Step 2: Alexander moves the carrot from the blue_container to the green_bathtub.
* Step 3: Logan moves the carrot back to the red_container.

So, the final location of the carrot is the red_container.

3. Output the answer: Based on our tracing, the correct answer is **B** - *red_container*
