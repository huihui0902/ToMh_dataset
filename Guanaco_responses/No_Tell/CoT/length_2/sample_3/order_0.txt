### Assistant: 1. Break down the question: "Where is the peas really?"

The key word here is "really." This suggests that there may be some deception involved, so we need to carefully consider what each agent has said and done.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:

Liam moved the peas to the blue_container.
Noah moved the peas to the green_crate.
Avery moved the peas to the blue_bucket.
Mila moved the peas to the blue_crate again.

It's important to note that these are the only relevant movements involving the peas. We can ignore any other actions that don't directly involve the peas.

3. Determine the last position of the peas:

Based on our tracing of the movements, the last position of the peas was in the blue_crate.

4. Output the answer:

The peas are really in the blue_crate
