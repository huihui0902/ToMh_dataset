### Assistant: 1. Break down the question into simpler parts:

Q1: Where does Ella think the lime is?
Q2: Where does Lily think the lime is?
Q3: Where does Emily think the lime is?
Q4: Where does Owen think the lime is?

2. Trace relevant agents' beliefs step by step:

Ella:
Step 1: Ella knows that the lime is in the red_bottle (from statement 3).
Step 2: Lily moves the lime to the blue_drawer (from statement 4), but Ella has not seen this movement since she left the front_yard before Lily did (from statements 5 and 6). So, her belief remains unchanged.
Step 3: Ella enters the waiting_room (from statement 15). She sees Lily enter the attic (from statement 16).
Step 4: Lily loses his phone (from statement 22). This event has nothing to do with the location of the lime, so Ella's belief remains unchanged.
Step 5: Lily leaves the attic (from statement 23). Ella still believes that the lime is in the red_bottle.
Step 6: Ella leaves the waiting_room (from statement 24). Her belief remains unchanged.
Lily:
Step 1: Lily knows that the lime was in the red_bottle when he entered the attic (from statement 3).
Step 2: He moves the lime to the blue_drawer (from statement 4).
Step 3: Lily stays in the attic for one minute without making any further movements (from statement 19). His belief remains unchanged.
Step 4: Lily leaves the attic (from statement 20).
Emily:
Step 1: Emily enters the attic after Lily (from statement 17).
Step 2: She sees Lily move the lime to the blue_drawer (from statement 4).
Step 3: Emily stays in the attic for one minute without making any further movements (from statement 21). She infers that Lily thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer.
Owen:
Step 1: Owen enters the front_yard after Lily (from statement 7).
Step 2: He sees Lily move the lime to the blue_drawer (from statement 4).
Step 3: Owen stays in the front_yard for one minute without making any further movements (from statement 8). He infers that Lily thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer.

3. Apply the assumptions to your trace:

According to assumption (2), we know that Ella can only infer Lily's belief from what she has seen in the waiting_room. However, Lily never mentioned anything about the lime there. Therefore, Ella still believes that the lime is in the red_bottle (based on Step 1 of Ella's trace above).
According to assumption (4), we know that Ella tends to trust Owen more than Lily since Owen exited the room later than Lily. But in this case, both Owen and Lily believe the same thing - that the lime is in the blue_drawer (based on Steps 2 and 3 of Owen's and Lily's traces above). So, Ella will likely trust their claim and believe that the lime is in the blue_drawer.
Therefore, the correct answer is **B**
