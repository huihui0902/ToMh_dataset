### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is. To answer this question, we need to start from Owen's perspective and work our way back to Emily's.

2. Trace relevant agents' beliefs step by step:
Owen knows that Lily moved the lime to the blue drawer (Step 4). He also knows that Evelyn moved the lime to the green pantry (Step 10), but he doesn't know why she did that since he was not present when it happened. Based on these facts, Owen believes that the lime is currently in the blue drawer.
Emily enters the picture in Step 15. She sees that Owen has already left the front yard, so she doesn't have any direct interaction with him. However, she can see that Lily has just moved the lime to the blue drawer (Step 14), which means that Owen's belief about the location of the lime is still correct.

3. Apply the assumptions to your trace:
Based on the assumptions, we can conclude that Emily will trust what she sees in the front yard more than what Owen said earlier. Since she saw Lily move the lime to the blue drawer right before she entered the front yard, she will believe that the lime is currently in the blue drawer. This means that her belief matches Owen's belief, and she would say that Owen thinks the lime is in the blue drawer.

4. Output your answer:
Based on my analysis, I would say that Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the blue drawer
