### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where the lime is after all the events described in the story.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:
Lime was initially in the red bottle (Step 3).
Then Lily moved the lime to the blue drawer (Step 4).
Evelyn moved the lime from the red bottle to the green pantry (Step 10), but she didn't like the asparagus so we can assume this movement did not happen.
Ella liked the red bottle which contained the lime (Step 2), but since she exited the front yard without making any movements (Steps 5-7), her preference does not change anything.
So, the last known location of the lime is still the blue drawer.

3. Determine the last position of the item:
Based on our tracing of the movements, the last known location of the lime is the blue drawer.

4. Output the answer:
The correct answer is "C" - the lime is in the blue drawer
