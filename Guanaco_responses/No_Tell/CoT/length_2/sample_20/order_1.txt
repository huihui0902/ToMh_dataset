### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where Nathan thinks the peas are after all the events described in the story.

2. Trace relevant agents' beliefs step by step:
Nathan enters the bathroom and sees that the peas are in the blue suitcase. He leaves without moving them. Later, he enters the kitchen and sees that the peas are now in the red box. He makes no movement and leaves. Finally, he reenters the waiting room where he has seen the peas being moved around several times.

3. Apply the assumptions to my trace:
According to the assumptions, Nathan will believe what he last saw. In this case, he last saw the peas in the red box, so he thinks they are still there.

4. Output my answer:
Based on my analysis, I would say that Nathan thinks the peas are in the red box
