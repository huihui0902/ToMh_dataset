### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where the tomato is after all the movements described in the story.

Sophia moves the tomato from the blue_container to the blue_cupboard (Step 3).
Jackson moves the tomato from the blue_cupboard to the blue_crate (Step 5).
Nathan moves the tomato back to the blue_container (Step 11).

3. Determine the last position of the tomato:
Based on the traced movements, we know that the tomato was last moved to the blue_container by Nathan (Step 11), so the correct answer is "K".
