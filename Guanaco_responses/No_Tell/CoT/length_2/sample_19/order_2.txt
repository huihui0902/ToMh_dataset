### Assistant: 1. Break down the question:
The question asks where **Nathan** thinks **Jackson** thinks the tomato is. So we need to determine what Nathan knows about Jackson's beliefs.

2. Trace relevant agents' beliefs step by step:
When Nathan enters the waiting room at step 13, he sees that there are already two tomatoes - one in the blue container and one in the blue cupboard. He also sees that Sophia has not yet left the laundry. At this point, Nathan believes that both tomatoes are still in their original locations.

At step 14, Nathan enters the hall along with Jackson and Amelia. When Nathan stays in the hall for one minute at step 16, he observes Jackson moving the onion from the blue treasure chest to the red envelope. However, since Nathan did not see any other movement related to the tomato, he assumes that the tomato is still in its original location.

After leaving the hall, Nathan reenters the waiting room at step 23. By now, he has learned that Jackson has seen a mouse and lost his phone. However, these events do not provide any new information about the tomato.

Finally, when Nathan leaves the waiting room at step 24, he has not received any new information about the tomato. Therefore, he continues to believe that the tomato is still in its original location.

3. Apply the assumptions to your trace:
Based on our trace of Nathan's beliefs, we can conclude that Nathan trusts Jackson's statements because Jackson exited the hall after him. This means that Nathan will consider Jackson's claim about seeing a mouse and losing his phone as genuine.

However, Nathan does not know that Jackson lied about seeing a mouse and losing his phone. Since these lies were not made in public, they cannot be verified by other agents.

Therefore, we can say that Nathan's beliefs are shaped by his observations and Jackson's public claims. He has no reason to doubt Jackson's statement that the tomato is still in its original location.

4. Output your answer:
Based on our analysis, we can confidently say that Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue container
