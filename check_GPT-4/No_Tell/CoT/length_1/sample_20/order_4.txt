1. Evelyn thinks Emily thinks Jacob thinks Ava thinks the watermelon is in the green_bottle because:
2. Evelyn saw Emily move the watermelon to the blue_bathtub and then exit the front_yard.
3. Evelyn knows that Emily saw Ava move the watermelon to the green_bottle and then exit the front_yard.
4. Evelyn knows that Emily knows that Jacob didn't make any movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.
