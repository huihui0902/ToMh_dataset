Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movement before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tends to lie. What an agent A tells others doesn't affect A's actual belief. An agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
