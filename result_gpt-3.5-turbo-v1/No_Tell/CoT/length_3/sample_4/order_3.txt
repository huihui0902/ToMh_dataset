Based on the assumptions given, we know that Jackson can only infer Benjamin's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

From the story, we don't have any information about Benjamin's thoughts on where the green pepper is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
