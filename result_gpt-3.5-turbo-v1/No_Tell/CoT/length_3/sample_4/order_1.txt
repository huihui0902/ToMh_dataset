1. Jackson, Emma, Abigail, Logan and Benjamin entered the living_room.
2. The green_pepper is in the red_basket.
3. Jackson moved the green_pepper to the blue_container.
4. Jackson exited the living_room.
5. Benjamin saw a cat.
6. Emma made no movements and stayed in the living_room for 1 minute.
7. Emma exited the living_room.

Based on the story and assumption (2), Emma cannot infer where the green pepper is because she did not witness Jackson moving it to the blue container. Therefore, we cannot determine where Emma really thinks the green pepper is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
