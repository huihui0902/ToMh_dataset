First, we need to determine where the green pepper is currently located. According to the story, it was initially in the red basket, but Jackson moved it to the blue container. Therefore, the green pepper is currently in the blue container.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the green pepper is. Jackson moved it, so he knows where it is. Benjamin saw a cat and made no movements in the living room, so he doesn't know where it is. Emma made no movements in the living room or bedroom, so she doesn't know where it is. Abigail made no movements in the living room or bedroom, but she stayed in the dining room for a minute. However, there is no information indicating that she saw where the green pepper was moved to. Logan dislikes the green pepper, but he moved the watermelon in the dining room and made no movements in the living room or bedroom, so he doesn't know where it is.

Now, we need to determine who Abigail thinks knows where the green pepper is. According to the assumptions, Abigail can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Abigail was in the same room as Emma, Jackson, and Logan in the dining room, but there is no information indicating that they discussed the location of the green pepper. Abigail was also in the same room as Benjamin, Emma, and Jackson in the bedroom, but again, there is no information indicating that they discussed the location of the green pepper.

Therefore, there is no way to determine where Abigail thinks Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is. The answer is not provided in the story and assumptions given.
