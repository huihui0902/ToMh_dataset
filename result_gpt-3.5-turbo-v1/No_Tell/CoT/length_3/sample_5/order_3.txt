First, we need to determine where the peas actually are. According to statement 2, the peas are in the green_basket. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the peas are. Mila and Amelia did not move or make any statements about the peas, so we cannot infer their thoughts on the matter. Jackson made no movements, but we know from statement 9 that he likes the green_bathtub, not the green_basket where the peas are. Hannah moved the peas to the blue_bathtub, so she knows that the peas are not in the green_basket. Abigail made no movements, so we cannot infer her thoughts on the matter.

Since Jackson made no movements and did not make any statements about the peas, we cannot directly infer his thoughts on the matter. However, we can use the assumption that an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. Since Jackson exited the patio before Amelia, he may trust her more than the other agents. 

According to statement 6, Amelia exited the patio after staying there for 1 minute. Since she did not move or make any statements about the peas, we cannot directly infer her thoughts on the matter. However, we can use the assumption that an agent can infer another agent's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Since Amelia and Jackson were both in the patio at the same time, it is possible that Jackson could infer Amelia's thoughts on the matter.

Therefore, the answer to the question is not directly stated in the story and cannot be determined with certainty. However, based on the information given, it is possible that Jackson thinks Amelia thinks Hannah thinks the peas are in the blue_bathtub (where Hannah moved them to), since Hannah is the only agent who moved the peas and Amelia and Jackson were both in the patio at the same time.
