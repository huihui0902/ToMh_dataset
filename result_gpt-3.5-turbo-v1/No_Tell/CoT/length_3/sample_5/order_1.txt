First, we know that the peas is in the green_basket according to statement 2. Mila, Amelia, and Jackson made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute each, so they didn't interact with the peas. Hannah moved the peas to the blue_bathtub according to statement 10. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, so she didn't interact with the peas either. 

Then, Hannah, Amelia, and Mila entered the lounge and moved the lemon around according to statements 15-22. Jackson didn't enter the lounge, so he didn't interact with the lemon or the peas. 

Finally, Hannah, Abigail, Mila, and Jackson entered the closet and Hannah moved the sweet_potato according to statements 26-28. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute, so she didn't interact with the sweet_potato or the peas. Mila and Jackson made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute each, so they didn't interact with the sweet_potato or the peas either. 

Based on these statements and assumptions, we can conclude that Hannah really thinks the peas is in the blue_bathtub, as that is where she moved it according to statement 10. Therefore, the answer is O. blue_bathtub.
