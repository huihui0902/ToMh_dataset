First, we need to determine where the watermelon actually is. According to the story, the watermelon is in the green_cupboard (line 3 and 26). 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the watermelon is. Mila moved the watermelon to the green_cupboard (line 13), so she knows where it is. Logan moved the watermelon to the red_bottle (line 31), so he also knows where it is. Chloe moved the lemon to the green_cupboard (line 22), but there is no indication that he knows where the watermelon is. Evelyn made no movements in the staircase where the watermelon was moved (lines 4 and 27), so it is unclear if she knows where it is. Charlotte made no movements in the staircase where the watermelon was moved (lines 9 and 18), so it is also unclear if she knows where it is.

Now, we need to determine who Chloe thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the watermelon is. Chloe and Logan were both in the staircase where the watermelon was moved (line 25). However, there is no indication that they had any private or public interactions about the watermelon. Therefore, we cannot determine what Chloe thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks about the watermelon's location.

Since we cannot determine the answer based on the given information, the correct answer is not listed among the options.
