1. Nathan moved the lettuce to the green_cupboard, but Logan moved it to the blue_treasure_chest. Therefore, Logan doesn't think the lettuce is in the green_cupboard.
2. Logan dislikes the lettuce, so he wouldn't think it's in the blue_treasure_chest. 
3. Isabella moved the lettuce to the blue_container, but we don't know if Logan witnessed this or not. 
4. Abigail moved the lettuce to the red_basket, but we don't know if Logan witnessed this or not. 
5. Therefore, we cannot determine where Logan thinks Nathan thinks Abigail thinks Isabella thinks the lettuce is. The answer is not provided in the story.
