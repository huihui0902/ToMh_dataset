1. Nathan, Logan, Jackson, Abigail and Isabella entered the back_yard.
2. The lettuce is in the blue_container.
3. Nathan moved the lettuce to the green_cupboard.
4. Nathan exited the back_yard.
5. Logan moved the lettuce to the blue_treasure_chest.
6. Logan exited the back_yard.
7. Jackson made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute.
8. Jackson exited the back_yard.
9. Abigail moved the lettuce to the red_basket.
10. Abigail exited the back_yard.
11. Isabella moved the lettuce to the blue_container.

From the story, we know that Abigail moved the lettuce to the red_basket, but we don't know what Abigail thinks about where Isabella thinks the lettuce is. We also know that Isabella moved the lettuce to the blue_container, but we don't know what Isabella thinks about where the lettuce is.

Since Abigail and Isabella were both in the back_yard at the same time, they could have had a private or public interaction. However, we don't have any information about their interaction or communication.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Isabella thinks the lettuce is. The answer is not provided in the story and cannot be inferred from the given assumptions. The correct answer is "Cannot be determined."
