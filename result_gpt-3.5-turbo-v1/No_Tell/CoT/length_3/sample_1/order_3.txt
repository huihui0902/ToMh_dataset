1. Nathan moved the lettuce from the blue_container to the green_cupboard. 
2. Logan moved the lettuce from the green_cupboard to the blue_treasure_chest. 
3. Abigail moved the lettuce from the blue_treasure_chest to the red_basket. 
4. Isabella moved the lettuce from the red_basket to the blue_container. 

Based on assumption (2), Nathan can only infer Abigail's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. According to the story, Nathan and Abigail were both in the back_yard and the hallway, but there is no mention of any private or public interactions between them. 

Therefore, Nathan has no way of knowing what Abigail thinks about the location of the lettuce. The answer is none of the above (not listed as an option).
