1. Nathan, Logan, Jackson, Abigail and Isabella entered the back_yard.
2. The lettuce is in the blue_container.
3. Nathan moved the lettuce to the green_cupboard.
4. Nathan exited the back_yard.
5. Logan moved the lettuce to the blue_treasure_chest.
6. Logan exited the back_yard.
7. Jackson made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute.
8. Jackson exited the back_yard.
9. Abigail moved the lettuce to the red_basket.
10. Abigail exited the back_yard.
11. Isabella moved the lettuce to the blue_container.

Based on assumption (3), we know that what Isabella tells others doesn't affect her actual thought. Therefore, we cannot trust that Isabella really thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container just because she moved it there. 

However, based on assumption (4), we know that Isabella tends to trust a agent that exited the room later than herself. Since Nathan exited the hallway after Isabella, she may trust his claim about the location of the lettuce. 

Looking at the story, we see that Nathan moved the lettuce to the green_cupboard in the back_yard, and then later moved the tangerine to the red_container in the hallway. Therefore, Isabella may really think that the lettuce is in the green_cupboard, not the blue_container. 

The answer is O. green_cupboard.
