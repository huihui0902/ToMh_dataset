1. Logan, Ava, Evelyn, Charlotte, and William entered the kitchen.
2. The sweet_potato is in the red_container.
3. Ava saw a mouse.
4. Logan made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute.
5. Logan exited the kitchen.
6. Ava moved the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard.
7. Ava exited the kitchen.
8. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute.
9. Evelyn exited the kitchen.
10. Charlotte moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer.
11. Charlotte exited the kitchen.
12. William moved the sweet_potato to the red_container.
13. William exited the kitchen.

Based on the assumptions given, William can infer that Charlotte thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_drawer because Charlotte was the last one to move the sweet_potato and William trusts her more than Logan or Ava who exited the kitchen before her. There is no information given about what Logan or Evelyn think about the sweet_potato's location, so their thoughts cannot be considered. Therefore, the answer is J. green_drawer.
