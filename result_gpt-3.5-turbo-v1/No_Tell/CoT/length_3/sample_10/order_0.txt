Based on the given assumptions, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say. We also know that an agent can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Therefore, we cannot infer the location of the sweet_potato based on what the agents say.

However, we do know that the sweet_potato was initially in the red_container and that it was moved to the blue_cupboard by Ava, then to the green_drawer by Charlotte, and finally to the red_container by William. Therefore, the sweet_potato is currently in the red_container. 

The answer is F. red_container.
