1. Logan, Ava, Evelyn, Charlotte and William entered the kitchen.
2. The sweet_potato is in the red_container.
3. Ava saw a mouse.
4. Logan made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute.
5. Logan exited the kitchen.
6. Ava moved the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard.
7. Ava exited the kitchen.
8. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute.
9. Evelyn exited the kitchen.
10. Charlotte moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer.
11. Charlotte exited the kitchen.
12. William moved the sweet_potato to the red_container.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Charlotte witnessed all the movements in the kitchen before she exited. Therefore, she knows that the sweet_potato was initially in the red_container, Ava moved it to the blue_cupboard, and then Charlotte moved it to the green_drawer. However, we don't know if Charlotte had any private or public interactions with Logan or Evelyn in the kitchen, so we cannot infer their thoughts.

Next, we know that Logan, Ava, and Evelyn entered the hallway, and Ava and Logan stayed there for 1 minute each. Based on assumption (4), Charlotte would trust Evelyn's thoughts more than Logan's since Evelyn exited the hallway after Logan. We also know that the peas is in the red_basket and Evelyn moved it to the green_bathtub. However, we still cannot infer Logan's or Evelyn's thoughts about the sweet_potato.

Finally, William, Logan, Evelyn, and Charlotte entered the bedroom. We know that Charlotte likes the green_bathtub and the banana is in the green_cupboard, which William moved to the green_bottle, Logan moved to the green_envelope, and Evelyn moved to the red_crate. However, we still cannot infer Logan's or Evelyn's thoughts about the sweet_potato.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
