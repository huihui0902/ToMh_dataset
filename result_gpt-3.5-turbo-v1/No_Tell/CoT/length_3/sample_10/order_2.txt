First, we need to determine where the sweet_potato actually is. According to statement 2, the sweet_potato is in the red_container. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the sweet_potato is. Ava moved the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard, but we don't know if she saw where it originally was. Charlotte moved it to the green_drawer, but we don't know if she saw where it was before. William moved it back to the red_container, so he knows where it is. Logan made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute, so he may or may not know where it is. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute, so she may or may not know where it is.

Now, we need to determine who Logan thinks knows where the sweet_potato is. Since Logan made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute, he may have seen where the sweet_potato was originally. However, we don't know if he saw Ava move it to the blue_cupboard or Charlotte move it to the green_drawer. We also don't know if he had any private or public interactions with Evelyn to infer her thoughts. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
