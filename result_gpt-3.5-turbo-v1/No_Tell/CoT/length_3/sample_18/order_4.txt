First, we need to find out where the lime is currently located. According to the story, the lime was initially in the blue_crate, but Elizabeth moved it to the green_pantry, and then Nathan moved it to the green_basket, and finally, Owen moved it to the red_box. Therefore, the lime is currently in the red_box.

Next, we need to determine the thought process of each agent. Nathan thinks that Owen thinks that Alexander thinks that Elizabeth thinks the lime is in a certain location. We know that Nathan moved the lime to the green_basket before exiting the workshop, and Owen moved it to the red_box after entering the workshop. Therefore, Nathan thinks that Owen knows that the lime is not in the green_basket but is in the red_box.

We also know that Alexander lost his phone and moved the plum to the red_drawer before exiting the workshop. Therefore, Nathan thinks that Alexander was in the workshop and knows that the plum is in the red_drawer, but he doesn't know where Alexander thinks the lime is.

Finally, we need to determine where Owen thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is. We know that Owen moved the lime to the red_box, but we don't know where he thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is. However, we do know that Elizabeth moved the lime from the blue_crate to the green_pantry before exiting the cellar. Therefore, Owen might think that Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry.

Based on this information, we can conclude that Nathan thinks Owen thinks Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry (option N). Therefore, the answer is N.
