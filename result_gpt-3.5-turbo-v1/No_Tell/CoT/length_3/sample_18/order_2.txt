First, we need to determine where the lime actually is. According to the story, the lime was initially in the blue_crate, then moved to the green_pantry by Elizabeth, then to the green_basket by Nathan, and finally to the red_box by Owen. Therefore, the lime is in the red_box.

Next, we need to determine which agents were in the same place as Elizabeth and had interactions with her. According to the story, Elizabeth was in the cellar with all the other agents, then in the waiting_room with all the agents, then in the workshop with Nathan, Jackson, and Alexander, and finally back in the waiting_room with Owen, Alexander, and Nathan.

Since Alexander was in the workshop with Elizabeth, he could have had interactions with her and potentially inferred her thoughts. According to the story, Alexander lost his phone and moved the plum to the red_drawer before exiting the workshop. Therefore, he may not have been paying close attention to Elizabeth's movements and thoughts.

However, we also know that Alexander tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself. Since Elizabeth exited the workshop after Alexander, he may trust her more than the other agents who were not in the workshop with him.

Based on the story and assumptions, we cannot determine with certainty where Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is. It is possible that he trusts her and thinks she knows the lime is in the red_box, or he may not have paid attention to her movements and thoughts. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given options.
