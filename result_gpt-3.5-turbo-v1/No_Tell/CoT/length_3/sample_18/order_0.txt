1. Elizabeth, Alexander, Nathan, Owen and Jackson entered the cellar.
2. Jackson lost his watch.
3. The lime is in the blue_crate.
4. Elizabeth moved the lime to the green_pantry.
5. Elizabeth exited the cellar.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Elizabeth moved the lime to the green_pantry before she exited the cellar. Therefore, the lime is not in the blue_crate anymore. 

6. Nathan saw a monkey.
7. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
8. Alexander exited the cellar.
9. Nathan moved the lime to the green_basket.
10. Nathan exited the cellar.
11. Owen moved the lime to the red_box.
12. Owen exited the cellar.
13. Jackson moved the lime to the blue_crate.
14. Jackson exited the cellar.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Nathan exited the cellar after Alexander, and Owen and Jackson exited the cellar after Nathan. Therefore, we can trust Nathan's claim that he moved the lime to the green_basket, and Owen's claim that he moved the lime to the red_box. We cannot trust Jackson's claim that he moved the lime to the blue_crate, because he exited the cellar before Owen and Nathan.

So, the lime is either in the green_basket or the red_box. 

15. Elizabeth, Alexander, Nathan, Owen and Jackson entered the waiting_room.
16. Nathan, Jackson and Elizabeth entered the workshop.
17. The sweet_potato is in the blue_suitcase.
18. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute.
19. Nathan exited the workshop.
20. Jackson made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute.
21. Jackson exited the workshop.
22. Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute.
23. Elizabeth exited the workshop.

Based on assumption (2), we cannot infer anything about the location of the lime from these events.

24. Nathan, Jackson and Elizabeth entered the waiting_room.
25. Elizabeth, Owen, Alexander and Nathan entered the workshop.
26. The plum is in the green_box.
27. Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute.
28. Elizabeth exited the workshop.
29. Owen moved the plum to the red_basket.
30. Jackson likes the blue_suitcase.
31. Owen exited the workshop.
32. Alexander lost his phone.
33. Alexander moved the plum to the red_drawer.
34. Alexander exited the workshop.
35. Nathan moved the plum to the green_cupboard.
36. Nathan exited the workshop.
37. Elizabeth, Owen, Alexander and Nathan entered the waiting_room.

Based on assumption (3), we cannot trust Alexander's claim that he moved the plum to the red_drawer, because he tends to lie. We can trust Owen's claim that he moved the plum to the red_basket, and Nathan's claim that he moved the plum to the green_cupboard. 

Therefore, the lime is in the green_basket, and the answer is D. red_basket.
