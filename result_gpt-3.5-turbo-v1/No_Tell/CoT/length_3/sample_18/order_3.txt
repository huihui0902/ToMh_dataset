First, we need to determine where the lime actually is. According to the story, the lime was initially in the blue_crate, then moved to the green_pantry by Elizabeth, then to the green_basket by Nathan, and finally to the red_box by Owen. Therefore, the lime is in the red_box.

Next, we need to determine where Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is. According to the story, Alexander moved the plum to the red_drawer and then exited the workshop. He did not witness Elizabeth's movements with the lime, so he cannot know for sure where she thinks the lime is. However, he may have heard Elizabeth claim that she moved the lime to the green_pantry before she exited the cellar. Therefore, he may think that Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry.

Finally, we need to determine where Owen thinks Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is. According to the assumption, Owen can only infer Alexander's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. From the story, we know that Owen and Alexander were both in the workshop with Elizabeth, but there is no mention of any private or public interactions between them regarding the lime. Therefore, Owen cannot know for sure where Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is. However, he may assume that Alexander trusts Elizabeth's claim and thinks that she believes the lime is in the green_pantry. Therefore, Owen may think that Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry.
