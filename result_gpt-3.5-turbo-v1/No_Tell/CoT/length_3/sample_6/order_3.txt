First, we need to determine where the turnip actually is. According to statements 2 and 26, the turnip is in the red_basket.

Next, we need to determine who has interacted with whom and who has been in the same place as whom. From statements 1, 14, and 25, we know that all five agents have been in the study at some point. From statements 15 and 24, we know that all five agents have been in the waiting_room at some point. From statements 16, 18, 20, and 25, we know that Noah, Logan, Hannah, and Elizabeth have been in the dining_room at some point. From statement 25, we know that Lily has been in the study with Noah, Hannah, and Elizabeth.

Now, we need to determine who has made movements and where the turnip has been moved. According to statements 10 and 32, Elizabeth moved the turnip to the green_pantry, but then Hannah moved it to the blue_pantry according to statement 32. Noah moved the sweet_potato to the red_envelope and then Logan moved it to the green_drawer according to statements 18 and 20.

Based on assumption 4, we know that Noah tends to trust Logan more than Lily since Logan exited the study after Noah did. Therefore, Noah may have shared his thoughts with Logan about where he thinks the turnip is. However, we don't have any information about whether Noah has interacted with Lily or Hannah privately or publicly.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Noah thinks Lily thinks Hannah thinks the turnip is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
