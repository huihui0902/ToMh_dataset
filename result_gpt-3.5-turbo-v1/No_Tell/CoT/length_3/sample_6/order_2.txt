1. Hannah, Lily, Logan, Elizabeth, and Noah entered the study.
2. The turnip is in the red_basket.
3. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
4. Hannah exited the study.
5. Lily made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
6. Lily exited the study.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Lily can only infer Hannah's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. However, we don't have any information about whether Hannah and Lily had any interactions or were in the same place at the same time. Therefore, we cannot determine where Lily thinks Hannah thinks the turnip is. The answer is unknown.
