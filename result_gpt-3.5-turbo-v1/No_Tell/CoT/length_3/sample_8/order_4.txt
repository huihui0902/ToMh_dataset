First, we need to find out where the lemon is currently located. According to the story, the lemon was moved to the green_basket by Aiden. Therefore, the lemon is in the green_basket.

Next, we need to determine who has interacted with the lemon and in what order. Jack moved the lemon to the blue_pantry, Liam moved it to the blue_crate, and Nathan moved it back to the green_drawer. Aiden did not interact with the lemon after it was moved to the green_basket.

Now, we need to determine Liam's thought process. Liam exited the garage after moving the lemon to the blue_crate. Jack exited the garage after Liam. Nathan moved the eggplant to the blue_crate after Liam exited the garage. Aiden exited the garage after moving the cherry to the green_crate. Therefore, Liam would trust Nathan's thoughts more than Aiden's thoughts.

Based on this information, Liam would think that Nathan thinks the lemon is in the green_drawer, as that was the last place Nathan saw the lemon. However, we do not know what Jack thinks about the location of the lemon, as he did not interact with it after it was moved to the blue_pantry. Therefore, we cannot determine where Liam thinks Jack thinks Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is.

The answer is: Not determinable from the given information.
