Based on the story and assumptions, we know that the agents tend to lie and that we can only infer another agent's thought if we have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that the exit order is known to all agents and that they tend to trust an agent that exited the room later than themselves.

From the story, we can see that the lemon was initially in the green_drawer, then moved to the blue_pantry by Jack, then to the blue_crate by Liam, then to the green_basket by Aiden, and finally to the green_drawer by Nathan. We also know that Jack likes the green_drawer and that Nathan saw a cat.

Based on this information, we can infer that Nathan may have moved the lemon back to the green_drawer because he saw that Jack likes it there. Therefore, the answer is L. green_drawer.
