1. Jack, Liam, Aiden, Sophia and Nathan entered the garage.
2. The lemon is in the green_drawer.
3. Jack moved the lemon to the blue_pantry.
4. Jack exited the garage.
5. Liam moved the lemon to the blue_crate.
6. Liam exited the garage.
7. Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket.
8. Aiden exited the garage.

Based on assumption (3), we cannot trust what Aiden told others about the lemon's location. However, we can infer Aiden's actual thought based on his movements and the exit order of the agents.

Aiden exited the garage after Liam, who moved the lemon to the blue_crate. Based on assumption (4), Aiden is more likely to trust Liam's movements and think that the lemon is in the blue_crate. Therefore, the answer is B. blue_crate.
