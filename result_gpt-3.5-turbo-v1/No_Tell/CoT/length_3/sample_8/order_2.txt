1. Jack, Liam, Aiden, Sophia and Nathan entered the garage.
2. The lemon is in the green_drawer.
3. Jack moved the lemon to the blue_pantry.
4. Jack exited the garage.
5. Liam moved the lemon to the blue_crate.
6. Liam exited the garage.
7. Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket.
8. Aiden exited the garage.
9. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute.
10. Sophia exited the garage.
11. Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer.
12. Nathan exited the garage.

Based on assumption (4), Nathan trusts Aiden more than Jack and Liam because Aiden exited the garage after Nathan. Therefore, Nathan thinks that Aiden thinks the lemon is in the green_basket (option O). 

So the answer is O. green_basket.
