First, Jack moved the lemon from the green_drawer to the blue_pantry, so he knows the current location of the lemon. Then, Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer, but we need to determine where Jack thinks Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is.

We know that Jack, Liam, Aiden, Sophia, and Nathan were all in the garage together, so they could have had public interactions. However, we don't know if Nathan and Aiden had any private interactions.

We also know that Jack exited the garage before Liam and Nathan, so he would tend to trust their claims more than Aiden's.

Based on the information given, we can't determine where Jack thinks Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is. The story doesn't provide any clues about their thoughts or interactions regarding the lemon's location. Therefore, the answer is unknown or cannot be determined.
