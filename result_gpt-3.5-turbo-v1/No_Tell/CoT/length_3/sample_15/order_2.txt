1. Jacob, Mila, Elizabeth, Aiden and Amelia entered the master_bedroom.
2. The sweet_potato is in the green_bottle.
3. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
4. Jacob exited the master_bedroom.
5. Mila made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
6. Mila exited the master_bedroom.
7. Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
8. Elizabeth exited the master_bedroom.
9. Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket.
10. Aiden exited the master_bedroom.

Based on assumption (4), Aiden trusts Jacob's opinion more than Mila's or Elizabeth's because Jacob exited the master_bedroom after Aiden did. However, we don't have any information about whether Aiden and Jacob had any private or public interactions in the master_bedroom, so we cannot infer what Jacob thinks about the sweet_potato's location.

Therefore, the answer is: None of the above.
