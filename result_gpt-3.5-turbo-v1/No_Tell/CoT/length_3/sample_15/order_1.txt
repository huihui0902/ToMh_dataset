1. Jacob entered the master_bedroom with the sweet_potato in the green_bottle.
2. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
3. Jacob exited the master_bedroom.
4. Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket.
5. Amelia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle.
6. Jacob, Mila, Elizabeth, Aiden and Amelia entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Jacob witnessed Aiden moving the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket and Amelia moving it back to the green_bottle. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what Jacob or any other agent says about their thoughts.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Jacob really thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is not provided in the story and assumptions given.
