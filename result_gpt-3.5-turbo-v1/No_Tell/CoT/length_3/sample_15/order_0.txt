9. Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket.
10. Aiden exited the master_bedroom.
11. Amelia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle.
12. Amelia exited the master_bedroom.

Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Amelia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle, but we also know that every agent tends to lie. Therefore, we cannot trust Amelia's claim about the sweet_potato's location. However, we also know that Aiden moved the sweet_potato after Amelia, and Aiden exited the master_bedroom after Amelia. Therefore, we can infer that Aiden's claim about the sweet_potato's location in the blue_bucket is more trustworthy than Amelia's claim. Therefore, the answer is C. blue_bucket.
