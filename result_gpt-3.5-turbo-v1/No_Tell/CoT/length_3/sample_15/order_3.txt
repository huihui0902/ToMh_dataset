First, we know that Aiden moved the sweet_potato from the green_bottle to the blue_bucket. However, we don't know if Mila witnessed this movement or not. 

Next, we know that Amelia moved the sweet_potato back to the green_bottle before leaving the master_bedroom. Again, we don't know if Mila witnessed this movement or not. 

We also know that Jacob made no movements while in the master_bedroom, so he didn't move the sweet_potato. 

Based on assumption (2), Mila can only infer Jacob's thoughts if they had private or public interactions. However, there is no mention of any interactions between Mila and Jacob in the master_bedroom. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Mila thinks Aiden thinks Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is not provided in the story and assumptions. The correct answer is "Cannot be determined".
