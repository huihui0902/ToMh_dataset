Based on the story and assumption (1) and (3), we know that the agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust what they say. We need to rely on their movements and actions.

From the story, we know that the persimmon was initially in the red_basket, then Hannah moved it to the blue_crate, and then Carter moved it to the green_basket, and finally, William moved it to the red_basket. Therefore, the persimmon is in the red_basket.

The answer is A. red_crate.
