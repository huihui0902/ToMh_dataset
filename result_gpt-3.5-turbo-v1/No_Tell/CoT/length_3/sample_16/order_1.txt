1. Hannah, Alexander, Carter, Avery and William entered the bedroom.
2. The persimmon is in the red_basket.
3. Hannah moved the persimmon to the blue_crate.
4. Hannah exited the bedroom.
5. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
6. Alexander exited the bedroom.
7. Carter moved the persimmon to the green_basket.
8. Carter exited the bedroom.
9. Avery made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
10. Avery exited the bedroom.
11. William moved the persimmon to the red_basket.
12. William exited the bedroom.

Based on assumption (4), we know that William tends to trust the agent who exited the room later than himself. Since William exited the bedroom last, he would trust his own memory of where he moved the persimmon. Therefore, William really thinks the persimmon is in the red_basket. The answer is F. red_basket.
