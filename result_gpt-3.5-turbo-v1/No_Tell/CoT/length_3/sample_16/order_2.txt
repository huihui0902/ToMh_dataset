1. Hannah moved the persimmon from the red_basket to the blue_crate.
2. Carter moved the persimmon from the blue_crate to the green_basket.
3. William moved the persimmon from the green_basket to the red_basket.

Based on assumption (4), Hannah would trust William's judgment on the location of the persimmon since he exited the garage after her. 

Therefore, Hannah would think that William thinks the persimmon is in the red_basket. 

The answer is F. red_basket.
