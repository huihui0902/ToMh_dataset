1. William entered the porch with four other people.
2. The melon is in the green_bathtub.
3. William made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute.
4. William exited the porch.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that William witnessed everything that happened in the porch before he exited. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what William says to others. We need to look at his actions and movements to infer his actual thoughts.

Since William made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute, we can assume that he was observing the other agents and their movements. We also know that he exited the porch before Lily, Aiden, Emma, and Isla. Therefore, he may trust their claims less than his own observations.

According to observation 2, the melon is in the green_bathtub. Since William witnessed everything that happened in the porch, we can assume that he saw Aiden move the melon to the blue_pantry. However, we cannot trust Aiden's claim that the melon is in the blue_pantry because he exited the porch before William.

Therefore, based on his observations and the assumption that he trusts agents who exited later than him, we can infer that William really thinks the melon is in the green_bathtub. The answer is A. green_bathtub.
