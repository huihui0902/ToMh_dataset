First, we know that William did not make any movements in the porch and then exited. Therefore, he did not move the melon to any other place. 

Next, Lily also did not move the melon in the porch and then exited. 

Aiden moved the melon to the blue_pantry, but we do not know if Lily was present when he did so. 

Emma moved the melon to the green_bucket, but again, we do not know if Lily was present when she did so. 

Finally, Isla moved the melon to the green_bathtub, but we do not know if Lily was present when she did so. 

Based on these facts, we cannot determine where Lily thinks William thinks the melon is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information.
