1. Isabella, Jack, William, Noah and Aiden entered the playroom.
2. The pear is in the blue_crate.
3. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the playroom for 1 minute.
4. Isabella exited the playroom.
5. William dislikes the peas.
6. Jack moved the pear to the blue_drawer.
7. Aiden lost his watch.
8. Jack exited the playroom.
9. William moved the pear to the green_crate.
10. William exited the playroom.
11. Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase.
12. Noah exited the playroom.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Noah witnessed every movement before he exited the playroom. Therefore, he knows that the pear was moved from the blue_crate to the blue_drawer by Jack, and then from the blue_drawer to the green_crate by William, before he moved it to the blue_suitcase.

Based on assumption (3), we cannot trust what the other agents say about their thoughts. Therefore, we cannot rely on William's statement that he dislikes peas to infer anything about his thoughts on the pear.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Noah trusts Jack more than William, since Jack exited the playroom after William. Therefore, Noah may be more likely to believe that the pear is in the blue_crate (which Jack moved it to) rather than the green_crate (which William moved it to).

Therefore, the answer is L. blue_crate.
