First, we need to determine where the pear actually is. According to the story, the pear was moved multiple times and ended up in the blue_crate (statement 2, 6, 11, and 14).

Next, we need to determine who Isabella thinks William thinks Noah thinks the pear is. Isabella was in the playroom with Noah and Aiden, but not with William or Jack (statement 3 and 4). Therefore, Isabella cannot directly infer William's thoughts about the pear.

However, Isabella may have overheard William's claims about the pear before he exited the playroom. According to the story, William moved the pear to the green_crate before exiting the playroom (statement 9 and 10). Isabella may have heard this claim and assumed that William thinks the pear is in the green_crate.

Now, we need to determine where Noah thinks the pear is. Noah was in the playroom with Isabella, Jack, and Aiden, but not with William (statement 13). Therefore, Noah cannot directly infer William's thoughts about the pear.

However, Noah may have overheard William's claims about the pear before he exited the playroom. According to the story, William moved the pear to the green_crate before exiting the playroom (statement 9 and 10). Noah may have heard this claim and assumed that William thinks the pear is in the green_crate.

Finally, we need to determine where Isabella thinks William thinks Noah thinks the pear is. Isabella may have overheard William's claims about the pear before he exited the playroom and assumed that he thinks the pear is in the green_crate. Isabella was also in the playroom with Noah, who she may assume thinks the pear is in the same place as William (since he may have heard William's claim). Therefore, Isabella may think that William thinks Noah thinks the pear is in the green_crate.

Therefore, the answer is B. green_drawer.
