1. Isabella, Jack, William, Noah and Aiden entered the playroom.
2. The pear is in the blue_crate.
3. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the playroom for 1 minute.
4. Isabella exited the playroom.
5. William dislikes the peas.
6. Jack moved the pear to the blue_drawer.
7. Aiden lost his watch.
8. Jack exited the playroom.
9. William moved the pear to the green_crate.
10. William exited the playroom.
11. Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase.
