First, Mila moved the peas from the green_treasure_chest to the blue_bucket, so the peas are not in the green_treasure_chest anymore. Then, Carter moved the peas from the blue_bucket to the green_bucket. So, at the end, the peas are in the green_bucket. 

Amelia moved the peas from the green_bucket to the blue_cupboard. However, we don't know what Amelia thinks about where the peas are. 

Isla made no movements in the staircase, so she didn't move the peas. We also don't know what Isla thinks about where the peas are. 

Carter exited the staircase after moving the peas to the green_bucket, so he knows that the peas are in the green_bucket. However, we don't know what Carter thinks about where Amelia and Isla think the peas are. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Carter thinks Amelia thinks Isla thinks the peas are. The answer is not provided in the story and assumptions given.
