1. Mila, Carter, Isla, Amelia and Emma entered the staircase.
2. The peas is in the green_treasure_chest.
3. Mila moved the peas to the blue_bucket.
4. Mila exited the staircase.
5. Carter moved the peas to the green_bucket.
6. Carter exited the staircase.
7. Isla made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
8. Isla exited the staircase.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Isla can only infer the location of the peas if she had private or public interactions with someone who moved the peas. Mila and Carter both moved the peas, but we don't know if they had any interactions with Isla. Therefore, we cannot determine where Isla really thinks the peas is. The answer is unknown.
