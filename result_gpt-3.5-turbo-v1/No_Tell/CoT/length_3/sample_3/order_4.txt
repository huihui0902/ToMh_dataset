First, Mila moved the peas from the green_treasure_chest to the blue_bucket. Then, Carter moved the peas from the blue_bucket to the green_bucket. Amelia later moved the peas from the green_bucket to the blue_cupboard. Mila exited the staircase before Carter, so Mila would trust Carter's thoughts more than her own. However, Mila did not witness Amelia's movements, so she cannot infer Amelia's thoughts. Isla made no movements with the peas, so Mila cannot infer Isla's thoughts either. Therefore, Mila can only guess where Carter thinks the peas are. Based on the assumption that every agent tends to lie, we cannot trust what Carter claims about the peas' location. Therefore, we cannot determine where Mila thinks Carter thinks Amelia thinks Isla thinks the peas is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
