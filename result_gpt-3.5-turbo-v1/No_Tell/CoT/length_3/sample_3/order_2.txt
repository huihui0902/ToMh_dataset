1. Mila moved the peas from the green_treasure_chest to the blue_bucket, so the peas are not in the green_treasure_chest anymore.
2. Carter moved the peas from the blue_bucket to the green_bucket, so the peas are not in the blue_bucket anymore.
3. Amelia moved the peas from the green_bucket to the blue_cupboard, so the peas are not in the green_bucket anymore.
4. Isla made no movements related to the peas, so she doesn't know where the peas are.
5. Amelia exited the staircase before Isla, so Isla cannot trust Amelia's claim about the location of the peas.
6. Therefore, we cannot determine where Isla thinks the peas are based on the given information.

Answer: Cannot be determined.
