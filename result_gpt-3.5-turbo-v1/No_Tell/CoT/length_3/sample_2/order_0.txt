1. Emily, Charlotte, Owen, Nathan and Liam entered the attic.
2. The onion is in the blue_treasure_chest.
3. Emily made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.
4. Emily exited the attic.
5. Charlotte moved the onion to the green_treasure_chest.
6. Charlotte exited the attic.
7. Owen moved the onion to the red_drawer.
8. Owen exited the attic.
9. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.
10. Nathan exited the attic.
11. Liam made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.
12. Liam exited the attic.
13. Nathan lost his gloves.

Based on the given assumptions, we can infer that Emily, Charlotte, Owen, Nathan, and Liam cannot be trusted completely. Therefore, we cannot rely on their statements about the onion's location. We need to look for evidence.

From step 2, we know that the onion is in the blue_treasure_chest. However, in step 5, Charlotte moved the onion to the green_treasure_chest. Then, in step 7, Owen moved the onion to the red_drawer. Finally, in step 28, we find out that the onion is in the red_drawer.

Therefore, the correct answer is N. red_drawer.
