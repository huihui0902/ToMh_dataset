First, we need to determine where the onion actually is. According to the story, the onion was initially in the blue_treasure_chest, then moved to the green_treasure_chest by Charlotte, and finally moved to the red_drawer by Owen. Therefore, the onion is in the red_drawer.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the onion is. Emily was in the attic when the onion was moved to the green_treasure_chest, so she does not know where the onion is currently. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute, so he also does not know where the onion is. Liam made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute, so he also does not know where the onion is. Charlotte was in the attic when the onion was moved to the red_drawer by Owen, so she knows where the onion is.

Now, we need to determine who Emily thinks Nathan trusts. According to assumption (4), Emily would tend to trust Liam more than Nathan because Liam exited the attic after Nathan. However, we do not have any information about Liam's thoughts on the location of the onion. Therefore, we cannot use this assumption to determine where Emily thinks Nathan thinks the onion is.

Finally, we need to determine if there is any public or private communication between Emily and Nathan that would give Emily insight into Nathan's thoughts on the location of the onion. According to the story and assumptions, there is no public or private communication between Emily and Nathan that would give Emily insight into Nathan's thoughts on the location of the onion.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Emily thinks Nathan thinks the onion is. The answer is not given in the story and assumptions provided.
