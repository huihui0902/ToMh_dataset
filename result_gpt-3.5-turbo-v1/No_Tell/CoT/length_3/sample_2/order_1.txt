1. Emily, Charlotte, Owen, Nathan and Liam entered the attic.
2. The onion is in the blue_treasure_chest.
3. Emily made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.
4. Emily exited the attic.
5. Charlotte moved the onion to the green_treasure_chest.
6. Charlotte exited the attic.
7. Owen moved the onion to the red_drawer.
8. Owen exited the attic.
9. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.
10. Nathan exited the attic.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Nathan can only infer the onion's location if he has had private or public interactions with someone who knows where the onion is. From the story, we know that Nathan did not move the onion and did not have any private interactions with anyone who moved the onion. However, he was in the attic with Owen, who moved the onion to the red_drawer. 

Since Nathan trusts agents who exit the room later than himself, he may believe Owen's claim that the onion is in the red_drawer. Therefore, the answer is N. red_drawer.
