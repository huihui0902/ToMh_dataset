First, we need to determine where the onion actually is. According to the story, the onion was initially in the blue_treasure_chest, then moved to the green_treasure_chest by Charlotte, and finally moved to the red_drawer by Owen. Therefore, the onion is in the red_drawer.

Next, we need to determine where Emily thinks the onion is. Emily did not move the onion and only stayed in the attic for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, we cannot determine where Emily thinks the onion is based on her actions.

However, we can use the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves. Nathan exited the attic after Emily, so Emily may trust Nathan's opinion on the location of the onion. But we also need to consider that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot fully trust Nathan's claim.

According to the story, Nathan made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, we cannot determine where Nathan thinks the onion is based on his actions.

Now, we need to determine where Owen thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks the onion is. Based on the assumption that agents can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions, we can assume that Owen and Emily have had some interaction in the attic or elsewhere.

Since we cannot determine where Emily thinks the onion is, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Emily thinks the onion is. Therefore, we cannot answer the question.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
