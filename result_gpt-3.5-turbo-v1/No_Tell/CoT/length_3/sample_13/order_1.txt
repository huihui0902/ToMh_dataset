1. William, Emily, Emma, Isla and Jackson entered the pantry.
2. The corn is in the green_bathtub.
3. William moved the corn to the green_cupboard.
6. William dislikes the corn.
28. William made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute.
30. Isla moved the corn to the green_cupboard.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that William tends to lie and that his actual thought is not affected by what he tells others. We also know that he tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself. 

From step 2, we know that the corn was initially in the green_bathtub. William moved the corn to the green_cupboard in step 3, but we don't know if he actually believed the corn was in the green_cupboard or if he was lying. 

In step 6, we learn that William dislikes the corn. This information doesn't directly tell us where he thinks the corn is, but it does give us insight into his attitude towards the corn. 

In step 28, we know that William stayed in the pantry for 1 minute without making any movements. This could suggest that he was trying to remember where he put the corn or where he thinks the corn is. 

Finally, in step 30, Isla moved the corn to the green_cupboard. Since William tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself, it's possible that he now believes the corn is in the green_cupboard. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is M. green_cupboard.
