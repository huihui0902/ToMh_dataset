First, we need to determine where the corn is currently located. According to the story, the corn is in the green_cupboard (step 30). 

Next, we need to determine who moved the corn to the green_cupboard. Isla moved the corn to the green_cupboard (step 30). 

Now, we need to determine who Isla thinks moved the corn to the green_cupboard. Isla made no claims about who moved the corn, so we cannot determine this information. 

Moving on to Jackson, we need to determine where he thinks Emma thinks Emily thinks William thinks the corn is. 

We know that Jackson moved the corn to the green_bathtub (step 13), but we need to determine where he thinks Emma thinks Emily thinks William thinks the corn is. 

According to the story, Emily moved the corn to the blue_crate (step 32), but we cannot determine what she thinks about where the corn is. 

We also know that Emma moved the corn to the green_bottle (step 35), but we cannot determine what she thinks about where the corn is. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Emma thinks Emily thinks William thinks the corn is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
