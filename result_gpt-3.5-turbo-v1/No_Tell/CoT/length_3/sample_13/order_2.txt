First, we need to determine where the corn actually is. According to the story, the corn was moved to the green cupboard by William, then moved to the red envelope by Emily, then moved to the green bottle by Isla, and finally moved back to the green cupboard by Isla. Therefore, the corn is currently in the green cupboard.

Next, we need to determine what William thinks about the corn's location. According to the story, William dislikes the corn and did not make any movements in the pantry when the corn was being moved around. Therefore, we cannot determine what William thinks about the corn's location.

Finally, we need to determine where Emily thinks William thinks the corn is. According to the assumption that an agent can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions, we can determine that Emily can only infer William's thought if they were both in the pantry at the same time or had private or public interactions about the corn's location.

From the story, we know that Emily moved the corn to the blue crate and saw a mouse before exiting the pantry. Therefore, we can assume that Emily did not have any private or public interactions with William about the corn's location. Additionally, we do not know if William was in the pantry at the same time as Emily when she moved the corn to the blue crate.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Emily thinks William thinks the corn is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
