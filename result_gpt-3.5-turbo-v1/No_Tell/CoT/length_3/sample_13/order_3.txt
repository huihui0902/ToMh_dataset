First, we need to determine where the corn actually is. According to the story, the corn was moved several times, but in the end, it was in the green cupboard (as per assumption 1). 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the corn is. William, Emily, Isla, and Jackson were all in the pantry when the corn was moved around, so they all know where it ended up. Emma, however, was not in the pantry when the corn was moved to the green cupboard, so she does not know where it is (as per assumption 2).

Now, we need to determine who Emma thinks William thinks the corn is. According to the story, William exited the pantry before the corn was moved to the green cupboard, so he does not know where it is (as per assumption 4). Emily, on the other hand, was in the pantry when the corn was moved to the green cupboard, so she knows where it is. However, we do not know if Emily told William where the corn is (as per assumption 5). 

Since we do not have enough information to determine if Emily told William where the corn is, we cannot determine where Emma thinks Emily thinks William thinks the corn is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
