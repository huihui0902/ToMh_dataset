First, we need to determine where the cabbage actually is. According to the story, the cabbage was moved by William to the blue treasure chest, then by Aiden to the blue bottle, and finally by Isla to the blue bathtub. Therefore, the cabbage is in the blue bathtub.

Next, we need to determine where Isla thinks the cabbage is. There is no direct information about Isla's thoughts on the cabbage's location. However, we do know that Isla likes the green bottle, so it is possible that she may have thought the cabbage was in the green bottle. However, this is just speculation and cannot be confirmed.

Finally, we can determine where Elizabeth thinks Isla thinks the cabbage is. According to the story, Elizabeth likes the green treasure chest, but there is no information about her thoughts on the cabbage's location. However, we do know that Elizabeth and Isla were both in the closet together, so it is possible that they had a private interaction and discussed the cabbage's location. Based on the information we have, we cannot determine where Elizabeth thinks Isla thinks the cabbage is. Therefore, the answer is unknown.
