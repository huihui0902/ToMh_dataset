1. Emily moved the eggplant from the green_pantry to the blue_drawer.
2. Emma moved the eggplant from the blue_drawer to the green_box.
3. Jack moved the eggplant from the green_box to the green_pantry.
4. The eggplant is currently in the green_pantry.

Based on assumption (2), Jackson can only infer Emma's thought if they have been in the same place or had private or public interactions. According to the story, Jackson made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute before exiting. Emma entered the garage with Emily, Avery, Jack, and Jackson, but there is no mention of any private or public interactions between Jackson and Emma.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Emma thinks the eggplant is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
