1. Emily, Avery, Emma, Jack and Jackson entered the garage.
2. The eggplant is in the green_pantry.
3. Emily moved the eggplant to the blue_drawer.
4. Emily exited the garage.
5. Avery made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute.
6. Avery exited the garage.
7. Emma moved the eggplant to the green_box.
8. Emma exited the garage.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Emma witnessed Emily moving the eggplant to the blue_drawer before she exited the garage. However, we don't know if Emma saw the eggplant being moved to the green_box after she left the garage. 

Assumption (2) tells us that Emma can only infer Emily's thought if they had private or public interactions. There is no mention of any such interactions between Emma and Emily regarding the eggplant. 

Assumption (3) tells us that we cannot trust what any character tells others. Therefore, we cannot rely on any statements made by any character regarding the location of the eggplant. 

Assumption (4) tells us that an agent tends to trust another agent who exited the room later than himself. However, we don't have any information about the exit order of Emma and Emily. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Emma really thinks the eggplant is. The answer is unknown.
