First, Abigail moved the cucumber from the blue_drawer to the blue_container. Then, Hannah moved the cucumber from the blue_container to the blue_bathtub. Finally, Owen moved the cucumber from the blue_bathtub to the red_pantry. Avery did not make any movements related to the cucumber. 

Based on assumption (2), Abigail can only infer Avery's thought if they have been in the same place or had private or public interactions. According to the story, Abigail, Avery, Jackson, Hannah, and Owen were all in the basement at some point, but it is not clear if they had any interactions related to the cucumber. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Avery thinks the cucumber is. The answer is not provided in the options given. The correct answer is not listed.
