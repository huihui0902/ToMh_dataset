1. Owen and Jack were both in the hall when the beans was moved to the green_treasure_chest by Jack. 
2. Owen then left the hall before Jack. 
3. Later, Owen, Jack, and Jackson were in the workshop, but there is no information about the beans in this location. 
4. Owen then left the workshop before Jack. 
5. Owen, Jack, Benjamin, and Jackson were all in the hall again when the beans was back in the blue_suitcase. 
6. Owen then left the hall before Jack. 

Based on these movements, Owen would likely think that Jack still believes the beans is in the green_treasure_chest since Jack was the last one to leave the hall after moving the beans to that location. Therefore, the answer is E. green_treasure_chest.
