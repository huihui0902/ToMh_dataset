1. Owen and Liam entered the hall together.
2. The beans is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Owen made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute.
4. Owen exited the hall.
5. Liam made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute.
6. Liam exited the hall.

Based on the assumptions given, Liam cannot infer Owen's thought about the location of the beans because they did not have any interactions or were not in the same place after they entered the hall. Therefore, the answer is not available and cannot be determined.
