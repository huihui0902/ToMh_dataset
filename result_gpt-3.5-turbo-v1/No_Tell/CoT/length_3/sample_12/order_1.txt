1. Owen, Liam, Jack, Jackson and Benjamin entered the hall.
2. The beans is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Owen made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute.
4. Owen exited the hall.
5. Liam made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute.
6. Liam exited the hall.
7. Jack moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest.
8. Jack exited the hall.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Jack tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. Since Jack exited the hall after moving the beans to the green_treasure_chest, he would trust the agent who exited the hall after him. However, we don't have any information about the exit order of Benjamin and Jackson, so we cannot determine who Jack would trust.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Jack really thinks the beans is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
