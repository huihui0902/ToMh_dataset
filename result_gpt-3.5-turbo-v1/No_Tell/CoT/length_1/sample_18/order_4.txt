First, we know that the corn was originally in the blue_treasure_chest, but Charlotte moved it to the green_crate. We also know that Jackson made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute, so he did not move the corn. Avery likes the blue_bathtub, but he also made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute, so he did not move the corn either. Liam and Benjamin also made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute, so they did not move the corn.

Therefore, the only person who could have moved the corn is Charlotte. However, we don't know if Charlotte told anyone else that she moved the corn. We also don't know if any of the other agents overheard Charlotte moving the corn or saw her move it.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that Charlotte can only infer Jackson's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We don't know if they had any interactions related to the corn. We also don't know if Liam and Benjamin had any interactions related to the corn.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Charlotte thinks Liam thinks Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks the corn is. The answer is unknown.
