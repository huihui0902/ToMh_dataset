Based on the assumptions given, we know that Liam can only infer Jackson's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

Since Jackson made no movements in the cellar and stayed there for only one minute, it's unclear what he was thinking about the corn. Charlotte moved the corn to the green_crate, so she knows where it is. Avery likes the blue_bathtub, but that doesn't give us any information about the corn's location. Liam made no movements in the cellar, so he doesn't have any information about the corn's location either. Benjamin also made no movements in the cellar, so he doesn't have any information about the corn's location.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Liam thinks Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks the corn is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
