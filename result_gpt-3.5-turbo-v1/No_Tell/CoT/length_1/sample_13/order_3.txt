First, we need to determine where the cabbage actually is. According to the story, the cabbage was initially in the red_container, but Amelia moved it to the green_envelope, Abigail then moved it to the green_crate, and finally Charlotte moved it to the blue_crate. Therefore, the cabbage is in the blue_crate.

Next, we need to determine who Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the cabbage is. Since Amelia exited the laundry before Abigail and Charlotte, she cannot know where the cabbage ended up. However, she knows that Abigail moved the cabbage to the green_crate before exiting the laundry. Therefore, Amelia might think that Abigail thinks the cabbage is in the green_crate.

As for Nathan, he made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, he did not witness any of the movements of the cabbage. However, he knows that Amelia exited before Abigail and Charlotte, and he might trust them more than Carter and himself since they exited later. Therefore, he might think that Abigail knows where the cabbage is and trust her judgment. Therefore, Nathan might think that Abigail thinks the cabbage is in the green_crate.

Therefore, the answer is H. green_crate.
