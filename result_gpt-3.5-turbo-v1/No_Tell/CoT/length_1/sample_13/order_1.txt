1. Amelia, Abigail, Charlotte, Carter, and Nathan entered the laundry.
2. The cabbage is in the red_container.
3. Amelia moved the cabbage to the green_envelope.
4. Amelia exited the laundry.
5. Abigail moved the cabbage to the green_crate.
6. Abigail exited the laundry.

Based on assumption (4), Abigail tends to trust Amelia's claim more than her own thought. Therefore, Abigail thinks the cabbage is in the green_envelope, which is where Amelia moved it to. 

The correct answer is I. green_envelope.
