1. Isabella moved the tomato from the green_bottle to the green_box.
2. Elizabeth moved the tomato from the green_box to the blue_container.
3. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
4. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.

Based on the assumptions given, Hannah can only infer Jacob's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Since Jacob made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute, it is possible that Hannah and Jacob had a private conversation during that time. However, we do not have any information about their conversation or what they discussed.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Jacob thinks the tomato is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
