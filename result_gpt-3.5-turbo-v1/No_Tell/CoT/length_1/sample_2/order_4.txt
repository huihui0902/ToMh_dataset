1. Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box before exiting the bedroom. Therefore, Isabella thinks the tomato is in the green_box.
2. Carter made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Carter doesn't know where the tomato is.
3. Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container before exiting the bedroom. Therefore, Elizabeth thinks the tomato is in the blue_container.
4. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Hannah doesn't know where the tomato is.
5. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Jacob doesn't know where the tomato is.
6. Elizabeth exited the bedroom after Carter. Therefore, Elizabeth tends to trust Carter more than Isabella.
7. Isabella exited the bedroom before Elizabeth. Therefore, Elizabeth tends to trust Isabella less than Carter.
8. Hannah exited the bedroom before Jacob. Therefore, Jacob tends to trust Hannah less than Isabella, Carter, and Elizabeth.

Based on the above assumptions, Elizabeth thinks Isabella thinks the tomato is in the blue_container (because Isabella moved it there before leaving the bedroom). Hannah's thoughts are not relevant to Elizabeth's thought process because Hannah exited the bedroom before Elizabeth and therefore Elizabeth tends to trust Isabella, Carter, and Jacob more than Hannah. Jacob's thoughts are also not relevant to Elizabeth's thought process because he exited the bedroom after Elizabeth and therefore tends to trust Elizabeth more than Jacob. 

Therefore, the answer is E. blue_container.
