Based on the assumptions given, we know that Isabella can only infer Hannah's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We also know that Isabella tends to lie, so what she tells others doesn't necessarily reflect her actual thoughts.

We don't have any information about Hannah's thoughts on the tomato's location, so we can't directly answer the question. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the given information.

Isabella moved the tomato from the green_bottle to the green_box, so she likely thinks the tomato is in the green_box. However, we don't know if Hannah was paying attention to Isabella's actions or if they had any interactions.

Elizabeth moved the tomato from the green_box to the blue_container, so she likely thinks the tomato is in the blue_container. Again, we don't know if Hannah was paying attention to Elizabeth's actions or if they had any interactions.

Hannah made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute, so we don't have any information about her thoughts on the tomato's location.

Jacob lost his watch and made no movements, so we also don't have any information about his thoughts on the tomato's location.

Based on the given information, we can't determine where Isabella thinks Hannah thinks Jacob thinks the tomato is. The answer is unknown.
