1. Isabella, Carter, Elizabeth, Hannah, and Jacob entered the bedroom.
2. The tomato is in the green_bottle.
3. Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box.
4. Isabella exited the bedroom.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Isabella witnessed the tomato in the green_bottle before moving it to the green_box. Therefore, we can eliminate option A (green_bottle) and choose option D (green_box) as the current location of the tomato.

5. Carter made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
6. Carter exited the bedroom.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Carter trusts Isabella's movements since she exited the bedroom before him. Therefore, we can assume that the tomato is still in the green_box.

7. Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container.
8. Elizabeth exited the bedroom.

Based on assumption (5), we know that Elizabeth's claim can be heard by anyone in the same place. Therefore, we can assume that the tomato is now in the blue_container.

9. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
10. Jacob lost his watch.
11. Hannah exited the bedroom.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Hannah trusts Elizabeth's movements since she exited the bedroom after her. Therefore, we can assume that the tomato is still in the blue_container.

12. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
13. Jacob exited the bedroom.
14. Isabella, Carter, Elizabeth, Hannah, and Jacob entered the waiting_room.

Based on the story, we do not have any information about Jacob's movements or thoughts regarding the tomato. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions based on his actions.

In conclusion, based on the given story and assumptions, the tomato is currently in the blue_container (option E).
