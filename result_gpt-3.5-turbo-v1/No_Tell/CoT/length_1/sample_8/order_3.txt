First, we know that Ella dislikes the corn, so she is unlikely to have moved it herself. We also know that Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase, but we don't know if Ella was aware of this. 

Next, we need to consider what Chloe might think about the location of the corn. We know that Chloe made no movements while in the crawlspace, so she did not move the corn herself. We also know that Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase, but we don't know if Chloe was aware of this. 

Finally, we need to consider where Ella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is. Based on the information we have, Ella has no reason to believe that Chloe knows where the corn is. Therefore, Ella's best guess for where Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is would be the same as her own guess, which is that the corn is still in the green_crate. 

Therefore, the answer is A. red_crate.
