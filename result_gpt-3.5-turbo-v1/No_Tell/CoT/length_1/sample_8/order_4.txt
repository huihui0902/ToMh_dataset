First, we know that Owen and Ella were both in the crawlspace and made no movements before exiting. Therefore, they both witnessed Sophia moving the corn to the blue_suitcase. 

Next, we know that Ella dislikes the corn, but we don't know if Owen is aware of this. 

Chloe made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute, so she didn't witness Sophia moving the corn. Therefore, she doesn't have any direct knowledge of where the corn is. 

Noah also made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute, so he also doesn't have any direct knowledge of where the corn is. 

Finally, we know that all five agents entered the waiting_room together. 

Based on these assumptions, we can conclude that Owen thinks Ella thinks Chloe doesn't know where the corn is, since Chloe didn't witness Sophia moving it. Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase, so Owen may think that Ella thinks Sophia thinks the corn is in the blue_suitcase. However, we don't have enough information to determine what Chloe or Sophia actually think about the location of the corn. 

Therefore, the answer is J. blue_suitcase.
