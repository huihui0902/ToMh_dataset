First, we need to determine where the spinach actually is. According to the story, the spinach is in the green_bucket (statement 3). 

Next, we need to determine who Mila interacted with and who she could have inferred information from. Mila was in the front_yard with Noah, Emily, Avery, and Evelyn (statement 2). Mila moved the spinach to the green_bucket (statement 13) and then exited the front_yard (statement 14). 

Noah was in the front_yard for 1 minute but made no movements (statement 4) before exiting (statement 5). Emily and Avery also stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute each but made no movements before exiting (statements 6-9). Evelyn also stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute but made no movements before exiting (statement 10). 

Based on assumption 4, Mila would tend to trust Evelyn's thoughts the most since Evelyn exited the front_yard last. However, we don't have any information about what Evelyn thinks about the spinach's location. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Mila thinks Noah thinks the spinach is located. The answer is not provided in the given information.
