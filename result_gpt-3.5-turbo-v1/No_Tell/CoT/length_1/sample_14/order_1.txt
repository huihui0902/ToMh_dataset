Based on the assumptions given, we know that Abigail can only infer the lime's location based on her own observations and interactions with other agents. We also know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust what they say.

From the story, we know that the lime was initially in the green_envelope, then moved to the blue_pantry by Emily, and then to the blue_suitcase by Jack. Avery and Aiden made no movements, and Abigail moved the lime to the green_envelope before leaving the playroom.

We also know that Emily likes the green_crate and Avery likes the red_basket, but this information does not help us determine the lime's location.

Based on the movements of the lime and the actions of the agents, we can conclude that Abigail thinks the lime is in the green_envelope, even though it was moved by Emily and Jack. Abigail was the last agent to interact with the lime before leaving the playroom, and she moved it back to its original location. Therefore, the correct answer is K. green_envelope.
