1. Emily moved the lime to the blue_pantry, and Jack moved it to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, Aiden knows that the lime is not in the green_crate, red_basket, green_basket, green_bathtub, green_drawer, blue_bathtub, blue_crate, blue_treasure_chest, red_box, red_bucket, green_bottle, or blue_drawer.
2. Avery made no movements and stayed in the playroom for 1 minute, so Aiden cannot infer anything about Avery's thoughts.
3. Abigail moved the lime to the green_envelope before exiting the playroom. Aiden knows that Abigail thinks the lime is in the green_envelope.
4. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the playroom for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Aiden trusts Abigail's claim about the lime's location more than Jack's claim, since Abigail exited the playroom after Aiden did.
5. Jack moved the lime to the blue_suitcase before exiting the playroom. Aiden knows that Jack thinks the lime is in the blue_suitcase.
6. Aiden does not have any information about where Emily thinks the lime is, so he cannot infer anything about where Jack thinks Avery thinks Emily thinks the lime is.
7. Therefore, the answer is M. Aiden thinks Jack thinks Avery thinks Abigail thinks the lime is in the blue_suitcase.
