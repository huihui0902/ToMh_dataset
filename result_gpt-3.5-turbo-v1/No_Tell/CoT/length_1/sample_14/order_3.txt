First, we need to determine where the lime is currently located. According to the story, the lime was moved from the green_envelope to the blue_pantry by Emily, and then from the blue_pantry to the blue_suitcase by Jack. Therefore, the lime is currently in the blue_suitcase.

Next, we need to determine where Abigail thinks the lime is. According to the story, Abigail moved the lime to the green_envelope before exiting the playroom. Therefore, Abigail thinks the lime is in the green_envelope.

Now, we need to determine where Avery thinks Abigail thinks the lime is. According to the story, Avery made no movements and stayed in the playroom for 1 minute before exiting. We don't have any information about Avery's private or public interactions with Abigail, so we cannot infer where Avery thinks Abigail thinks the lime is.

Finally, we need to determine where Jack thinks Avery thinks Abigail thinks the lime is. According to the assumptions, Jack tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. Since Jack exited the playroom before Avery, he does not trust Avery's thoughts. Therefore, we cannot determine where Jack thinks Avery thinks Abigail thinks the lime is.

Answer: Cannot be determined.
