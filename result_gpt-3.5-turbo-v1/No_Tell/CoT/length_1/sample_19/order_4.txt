First, we know that Emily, Abigail, Amelia, Elizabeth, and Hannah all entered the staircase together. Emily made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute before exiting. Abigail did the same, followed by Amelia, Elizabeth, and Hannah. Then, they all entered the waiting room.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Abigail can only infer Amelia's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

However, we don't have any information about where the asparagus is located, except for the fact that it is in a green bottle. We also don't have any information about any private or public interactions between Amelia and Hannah or Emily.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Amelia thinks Hannah thinks Emily thinks the asparagus is located. The answer is unknown.
