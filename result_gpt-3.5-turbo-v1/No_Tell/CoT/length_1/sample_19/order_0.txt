First, we know that Emily, Abigail, Amelia, Elizabeth, and Hannah all entered the staircase and then later entered the waiting room. We also know that each of them stayed in the staircase for one minute before exiting. 

Next, we know that the asparagus is in the green bottle. However, we don't know who said this or if it is true. 

Based on assumption (4), we can assume that Hannah is the most trustworthy since she exited the staircase last. However, we don't know if she made any claims about the location of the asparagus. 

Therefore, we cannot determine the true location of the asparagus with the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
