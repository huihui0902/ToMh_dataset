First, we need to determine if Emily had any interactions with the asparagus or the green bottle. According to the story, there is no mention of Emily interacting with the asparagus or the green bottle. 

Next, we need to consider if Emily had any interactions with the other agents who may have interacted with the asparagus or the green bottle. According to the story, Emily made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, it is unlikely that she had any interactions with the other agents who may have interacted with the asparagus or the green bottle. 

Based on these observations, we cannot determine where Emily really thinks the asparagus is. Therefore, the answer is unknown and cannot be determined from the given information.
