First, Liam entered the pantry and did not move the eggplant. Then, Noah lost his gloves. Jack moved the eggplant to the green bathtub and then exited the pantry. Hannah moved the eggplant to the blue cupboard and then exited the pantry. Owen moved the eggplant to the green basket and then exited the pantry. Finally, Noah moved the eggplant to the green envelope and then exited the pantry. 

Based on assumption (2), Hannah can only infer Noah's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Since Noah lost his gloves and did not move the eggplant, it is unclear if he had any interaction with Hannah. Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Noah thinks the eggplant is. 

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
