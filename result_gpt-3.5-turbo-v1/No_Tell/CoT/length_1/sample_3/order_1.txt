First, we know that Liam did not move the eggplant and only stayed in the pantry for one minute before leaving. Therefore, Liam cannot provide any information about the location of the eggplant.

Next, we know that Noah lost his gloves and moved the eggplant to the green envelope before leaving the pantry. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust Noah's claim that he moved the eggplant to the green envelope.

Jack moved the eggplant to the green bathtub before leaving the pantry, but we do not know if he communicated this to anyone else. Hannah then moved the eggplant to the blue cupboard before leaving the pantry, but again, we do not know if she communicated this to anyone else.

Finally, Owen moved the eggplant to the green basket before leaving the pantry. We also know that Owen exited the pantry after Noah, so according to assumption (4), Noah may be more likely to trust Owen's claim about the location of the eggplant.

Therefore, based on the information given, it is most likely that Noah thinks the eggplant is in the green basket (option J).
