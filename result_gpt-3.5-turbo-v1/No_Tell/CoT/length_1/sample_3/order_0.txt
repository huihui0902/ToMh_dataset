1. Liam, Jack, Hannah, Owen and Noah entered the pantry.
2. The eggplant is in the green_envelope.
3. Liam made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute.
4. Liam exited the pantry.

From the story, we know that Liam did not move the eggplant and he left the pantry. Therefore, we can eliminate all the options except for those that have the green_envelope as the location of the eggplant. 

5. Noah lost his gloves.
6. Jack moved the eggplant to the green_bathtub.
7. Jack exited the pantry.
8. Hannah moved the eggplant to the blue_cupboard.
9. Hannah exited the pantry.
10. Owen moved the eggplant to the green_basket.
11. Owen exited the pantry.
12. Noah moved the eggplant to the green_envelope.
13. Noah exited the pantry.
14. Liam, Jack, Hannah, Owen and Noah entered the waiting_room.

From the story, we know that Jack, Hannah, Owen, and Noah all moved the eggplant to different locations. However, we cannot trust their claims about where they moved the eggplant. We also know that Liam did not move the eggplant and he left the pantry before the eggplant was moved to its final location. Therefore, the only reliable information we have is that the eggplant was in the green_envelope when Noah left the pantry. 

Therefore, the answer is F. green_envelope.
