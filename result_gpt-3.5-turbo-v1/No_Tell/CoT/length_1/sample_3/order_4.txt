First, we need to determine where the eggplant actually is. According to the story, the eggplant was moved to the green_envelope by Noah. Therefore, the correct answer is F.

Next, we need to determine where Owen thinks Jack thinks Hannah thinks Noah thinks the eggplant is. Since Owen moved the eggplant to the green_basket after Hannah, he would trust her more than Jack or Liam. However, since Noah lost his gloves and may have been distracted, Owen may not trust his judgment as much. 

Based on this, Owen may think that Jack thinks Hannah thinks the eggplant is in the blue_cupboard, since that is where Hannah moved it to. However, since Noah ultimately moved the eggplant to the green_envelope, Owen may also consider the possibility that Jack thinks Hannah thinks the eggplant is in the green_envelope. 

Therefore, the possible answers are F (green_envelope) or H (blue_cupboard). However, since the question asks for where Owen thinks Jack thinks Hannah thinks Noah thinks the eggplant is, the more likely answer is H (blue_cupboard), since that is where Hannah moved the eggplant to and Owen may trust her judgment more than Noah's. 

Therefore, the answer is B. blue_treasure_chest.
