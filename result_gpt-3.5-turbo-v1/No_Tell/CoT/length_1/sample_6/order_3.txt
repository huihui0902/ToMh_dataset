First, we need to determine where the apple actually is. According to the story, the apple was moved from the green bathtub to the blue cupboard by Hannah, then to the green drawer by Jack, and finally to the red box by Lily. Therefore, the apple is in the red box.

Next, we need to determine where Hannah thinks the apple is. We know that Hannah likes the blue drawer, but she moved the apple to the blue cupboard. This suggests that she may have thought the apple was originally in the blue cupboard. However, we cannot be certain of her actual thought.

Now, we need to determine where Lily thinks the apple is. Lily moved the apple to the red box, so we know that she thinks the apple is in the red box.

Finally, we can answer the question. We need to determine where Jack thinks Hannah thinks Lily thinks the apple is. Since we know that the apple is in the red box, we can eliminate all answer choices except for N (red box) and O (blue cupboard). We also know that Hannah moved the apple to the blue cupboard, so Jack may think that Hannah thinks the apple is in the blue cupboard. However, we cannot be certain of his actual thought. Therefore, the answer is O (blue cupboard).
