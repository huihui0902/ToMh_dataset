1. Hannah, Jack, Lily, Logan and Aiden entered the closet.
2. The apple is in the green_bathtub.
3. Hannah moved the apple to the blue_cupboard.
4. Hannah exited the closet.

At this point, we know that the apple was in the green_bathtub, but Hannah moved it to the blue_cupboard before she left. So, the apple is not in the green_bathtub anymore.

5. Jack moved the apple to the green_drawer.
6. Jack exited the closet.

Now, we know that Jack moved the apple to the green_drawer after Hannah moved it to the blue_cupboard. So, the apple is not in the blue_cupboard anymore either.

7. Lily moved the apple to the red_box.
8. Hannah likes the blue_drawer.
9. Lily exited the closet.

Lily moved the apple to the red_box, but we don't know if the apple is still there or not. Hannah likes the blue_drawer, but we don't know if she moved the apple there or not.

10. Logan made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute.
11. Logan exited the closet.
12. Logan likes the green_pantry.

Logan didn't move the apple, but we know that he likes the green_pantry. However, we don't know if he saw the apple or not.

13. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute.
14. Aiden exited the closet.
15. Hannah, Jack, Lily, Logan and Aiden entered the waiting_room.

Aiden didn't move the apple either, and we don't know if he saw it or not. All five agents are now in the waiting_room.

Based on the information given, we can only conclude that the apple is either in the red_box or the blue_drawer. We don't have enough information to determine which one it is. Therefore, the answer is either N. red_box or O. blue_cupboard.
