1. Ella and Emma were both in the attic at some point, so Ella can infer Emma's thoughts.
2. The spinach was originally in the red_bottle, but Ella moved it to the green_basket.
3. Benjamin later moved the spinach to the green_envelope.
4. Aiden dislikes turnip, but there is no information about his thoughts on spinach.
5. Jack made no movements, so we don't know his thoughts on spinach.
6. Emma made no movements, but she was in the attic after Ella moved the spinach to the green_basket.
7. Ella exited the attic before Emma, so she may not know if Emma saw her move the spinach to the green_basket.
8. Ella may assume that Emma thinks the spinach is still in the red_bottle, since she didn't see Ella move it to the green_basket.

Therefore, the answer is G. red_bottle.
