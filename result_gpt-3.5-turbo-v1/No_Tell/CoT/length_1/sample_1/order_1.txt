1. Avery, Charlotte, Isabella, Elizabeth and Owen entered the living_room.
2. The lettuce is in the green_drawer.
3. Avery moved the lettuce to the green_bathtub.

Based on assumption (3), we know that what Avery tells others doesn't affect his actual thought. Therefore, we cannot trust what Avery said about the lettuce being in the green_drawer. We need to look at his actions instead.

According to step 3, Avery moved the lettuce to the green_bathtub. Therefore, Avery really thinks that the lettuce is in the green_bathtub.

The answer is O. green_bathtub.
