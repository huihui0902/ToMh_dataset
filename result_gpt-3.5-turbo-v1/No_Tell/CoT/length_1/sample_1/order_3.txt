13. Elizabeth exited the living room.
14. Owen moved the lettuce to the green drawer.
15. Owen exited the living room.
16. Avery, Charlotte, Isabella, Elizabeth, and Owen entered the waiting room.

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Owen trusts Avery more than Charlotte because Avery exited the living room after him. Therefore, Owen thinks that Avery knows where the lettuce is. 

We know that Avery moved the lettuce to the green bathtub, but we don't know if Charlotte knows this information. Charlotte moved the lettuce to the blue pantry, so it's possible that she doesn't know where the lettuce is currently located. 

However, we also know that Avery tends to lie, so it's possible that he told Charlotte a different location for the lettuce. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Charlotte thinks Avery thinks the lettuce is with certainty. The answer is not provided in the options given.
