Based on the assumptions given, we know that Avery can only infer Mila's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

We don't have any information about Mila's thoughts on the lettuce, so we can't infer what Avery thinks Mila thinks about it. We also don't have any information about Emma's thoughts on the lettuce, so we can't infer what Avery thinks Emma thinks about it.

However, we do know that Alexander moved the lettuce to the blue_container, and Avery saw a mouse. Based on this information, we can infer that Avery thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container, since that's where Alexander moved it. 

Therefore, the answer is I. blue_container.
