1. Mila, Liam, Emma, Alexander, and Avery entered the patio.
2. The lettuce is in the blue_crate.
3. Mila made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
4. Mila exited the patio.
5. Liam made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
6. Liam exited the patio.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Liam may have lied about his thoughts on the location of the lettuce. However, we can infer that Liam did not move the lettuce since he made no movements while in the patio. We also know that Alexander moved the lettuce to the blue_container.

Therefore, Liam's actual thought on the location of the lettuce is likely to be in the blue_crate, since that was the original location mentioned in the story and Liam did not move the lettuce. The answer is F. blue_crate.
