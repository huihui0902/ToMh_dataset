1. Avery entered the back_yard with the others.
2. The watermelon is in the blue_container.
3. Avery made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute.
4. Avery exited the back_yard.
5. Owen made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute.
6. Owen exited the back_yard.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Avery cannot infer where the watermelon is based on Owen's actions, as they did not have any interactions. Avery also made no movements and stayed in the back-yard for 1 minute, so it is unclear if they saw where the watermelon was moved to. However, we do know that Avery exited the back-yard before Ella moved the watermelon to the red_pantry, so it is unlikely that Avery thinks the watermelon is in the red_pantry. 

Therefore, the most likely answer is that Avery thinks the watermelon is still in the blue_container, as that was the last place they saw it before exiting the back-yard. The answer is L. blue_container.
