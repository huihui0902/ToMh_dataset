1. Avery and Owen entered the back_yard and made no movements before exiting. We don't have any information about the watermelon yet.
2. Ella entered the back-yard and moved the watermelon to the red_pantry. This means that the watermelon was initially in the blue_container, but now it's in the red_pantry.
3. Ava entered the back-yard and made no movements before exiting. We still don't have any new information about the watermelon.
4. Amelia entered the back-yard and moved the watermelon back to the blue_container. This means that the watermelon is now back in the blue_container.
5. All five agents entered the waiting_room, but we don't have any new information about the watermelon.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer that the watermelon is in the blue_container. Therefore, the answer is L. blue_container.
