1. Avery and Owen entered the back_yard and made no movements before exiting. Therefore, they have no information about the location of the watermelon.
2. Ella entered the back-yard and moved the watermelon to the red_pantry. Therefore, Ella knows that the watermelon is not in the blue_container anymore.
3. Ava entered the back-yard and made no movements before exiting. Therefore, Ava has no information about the location of the watermelon.
4. Amelia entered the back-yard and moved the watermelon back to the blue_container. Therefore, Amelia knows that the watermelon is in the blue_container.
5. All agents entered the waiting_room in the following order: Avery, Owen, Ella, Ava, and Amelia.

Based on the assumptions given, Amelia can infer Ella's thought only if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Since Ella moved the watermelon to the red_pantry before Amelia entered the back-yard, Amelia cannot infer Ella's thought about the location of the watermelon.

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information and cannot be determined.
