1. Avery and Owen entered the back_yard and made no movements before exiting. We don't know what they were thinking or where they thought the watermelon was.
2. Ella entered the back-yard after Avery and Owen had left. She moved the watermelon to the red_pantry. We don't know what she was thinking about where the watermelon was before she moved it.
3. Ava entered the back-yard after Ella had left and made no movements before exiting. We don't know what she was thinking about where the watermelon was.
4. Amelia entered the back-yard after Ava had left and moved the watermelon to the blue_container. We don't know what she was thinking about where the watermelon was before she moved it.
5. All five agents then entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Ella can only make assumptions about where Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is if they had private or public interactions. However, we don't have any information about whether they had any interactions or not. Therefore, we cannot determine where Ella thinks Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
