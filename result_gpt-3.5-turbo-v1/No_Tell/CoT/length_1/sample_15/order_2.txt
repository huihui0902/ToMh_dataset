1. Avery and Owen entered the back_yard together.
2. The watermelon is in the blue_container.
3. Avery made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute.
4. Avery exited the back_yard.
5. Owen made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute.
6. Owen exited the back_yard.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Owen can only infer Avery's thought if they had private or public interactions. However, there is no mention of any interaction between Avery and Owen in the story. Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is. The answer is not given in the story and cannot be inferred based on the given assumptions. The correct answer is "Cannot be determined".
