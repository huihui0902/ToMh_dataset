10. Abigail likes the red_pantry.
11. Ella made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
12. Ella exited the bedroom.
13. Owen moved the banana to the green_envelope.

Based on the assumption that every agent tends to lie, we cannot trust what Abigail said about liking the red_pantry. It doesn't affect her actual thought about the banana's location.

We know that Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle before exiting the bedroom. However, we cannot be sure if she really thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle. She could have moved it there to mislead the other agents.

We also know that Owen moved the banana to the green_envelope after Abigail left the bedroom. According to the assumption that an agent tends to trust another agent that exited the room later than himself, Abigail may think that the banana is in the green_envelope.

Therefore, the answer is G. green_envelope.
