Based on the assumptions given, we know that Ella can only infer Abigail's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't affect their actual thought.

From the story, we know that Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle and likes the red_pantry. However, we don't know if Ella was in the same place as Abigail or had any interactions with her. Therefore, we cannot determine where Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
