First, we know that Elizabeth and Ella were both in the bedroom at some point, but we don't know if they were there at the same time. We also know that Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle before leaving the bedroom. However, we don't know if Elizabeth was aware of this or not.

Next, we know that Ella made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before leaving. We don't know if she saw the banana or not, but we do know that Abigail moved it while she was in the room.

Finally, we know that Elizabeth left the bedroom before Abigail moved the banana, so she may not be aware of its current location. However, we do know that Owen moved the banana back to the green_envelope after Abigail left the room.

Based on these facts and assumptions, we can conclude that Elizabeth may not have a clear idea of where the banana is currently located. Therefore, it's unlikely that she would have a strong opinion on where Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is. The answer to the question is therefore unknown or cannot be determined from the given information.
