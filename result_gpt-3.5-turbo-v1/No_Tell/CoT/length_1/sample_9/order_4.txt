Based on the assumptions given, we know that Owen can only infer Elizabeth's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts. 

Since Owen moved the banana to the green_envelope, we can assume that he thinks the banana is in the green_envelope. However, we need to determine where he thinks Elizabeth, Ella, and Abigail think the banana is. 

We know that Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. This means that she did not interact with the banana or witness any movements related to it. Therefore, we cannot infer where she thinks the banana is. 

Ella also made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Like Elizabeth, we cannot infer where she thinks the banana is. 

Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle before exiting the bedroom. However, we also know that Abigail tends to lie, so we cannot trust her claim that she likes the red_pantry. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Elizabeth, Ella, and Abigail think the banana is. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
