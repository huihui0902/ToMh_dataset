Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer the following:

- The banana was initially in the green_envelope.
- Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle.
- Owen moved the banana back to the green_envelope.
- We don't have any information about the banana being moved again after Owen left the bedroom.

Therefore, the answer to the question is G. green_envelope.
