1. Isabella, Evelyn, William, Alexander and Logan entered the cellar.
2. The carrot is in the red_container.
3. Isabella moved the carrot to the blue_container.
4. Logan likes the green_drawer.
5. Isabella exited the cellar.
6. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
7. Logan likes the green_bucket.
8. Evelyn exited the cellar.
9. William made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
10. William exited the cellar.
11. Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub.
12. Alexander exited the cellar.
13. Logan moved the carrot to the red_container.
14. Logan exited the cellar.
15. Isabella, Evelyn, William, Alexander and Logan entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Alexander only knows the movements of Isabella, Logan, and himself. He does not know what Evelyn and William did in the cellar. Also, since Logan exited the cellar after Alexander, Alexander may trust Logan's thoughts more than his own.

From step 11, we know that Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub. From step 13, we know that Logan moved the carrot to the red_container. Therefore, Alexander knows that Logan does not think the carrot is in the green_bathtub.

We do not have any information about what Evelyn and William think about the location of the carrot. Therefore, we cannot use them to infer where Logan thinks the carrot is.

Since Alexander knows that Logan moved the carrot to the red_container, he may assume that Logan thinks the carrot is in the red_container. Therefore, Alexander may think that Logan thinks Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot is in the red_container.

Therefore, the answer is B. red_container.
