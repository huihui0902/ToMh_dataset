1. Isabella, Evelyn, William, Alexander and Logan entered the cellar.
2. The carrot is in the red_container.
3. Isabella moved the carrot to the blue_container.
4. Logan likes the green_drawer.
5. Isabella exited the cellar.
6. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
7. Logan likes the green_bucket.
8. Evelyn exited the cellar.
9. William made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
10. William exited the cellar.
11. Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub.
12. Alexander exited the cellar.
13. Logan moved the carrot to the red_container.
14. Logan exited the cellar.
15. Isabella, Evelyn, William, Alexander and Logan entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that William only knows the movements of Isabella, Evelyn, Alexander, and Logan before he exited the cellar. He did not witness the movement of the carrot to the red_container by Logan. Also, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say.

Therefore, we cannot determine where William really thinks the carrot is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the story.
