First, we know that Mila did not move the melon and did not exit the garden until after Ava moved the melon to the green_basket. Therefore, Mila cannot know where the melon is for sure. 

Next, Liam made no movements and stayed in the garden for 1 minute before exiting. He did not see where the melon was moved to, so he cannot know for sure where it is. 

Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle before exiting the garden. William was the last one to exit the garden and therefore would tend to trust Ella's claim about where the melon is. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust Ella's claim. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where William really thinks the melon is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
