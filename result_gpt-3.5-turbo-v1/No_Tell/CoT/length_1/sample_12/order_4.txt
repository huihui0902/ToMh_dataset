First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to statement 2, the melon is in the green_box.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the melon is. Ava moved the melon to the green_basket, so she knows where it is. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle, so she also knows where it is. Mila and Liam made no movements and did not see where the melon was moved to, so they do not know where it is. William also made no movements and did not see where the melon was moved to, so he also does not know where it is.

Now, we need to determine who each agent thinks knows where the melon is. Since Mila made no movements and did not see where the melon was moved to, she cannot have an opinion on where it is. Ava moved the melon to the green_basket, so she knows where it is and likely thinks that Ella and William do not know where it is. Liam made no movements and did not see where the melon was moved to, so he cannot have an opinion on where it is. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle, so she knows where it is and likely thinks that Mila and Liam do not know where it is. William made no movements and did not see where the melon was moved to, so he cannot have an opinion on where it is.

Finally, we need to determine where Ava thinks Ella thinks Mila thinks William thinks the melon is. Since the melon is in the green_box and Mila, Liam, and William do not know where it is, they cannot have an opinion on where it is. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle, so she knows it is not in the green_box. Therefore, Ava likely thinks that Ella thinks that Mila thinks that the melon is not in the green_box. However, we cannot determine where Ava thinks Ella thinks the melon is specifically, as there is not enough information given about their interactions or private thoughts.

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options given.
