First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to statement 2, the melon is in the green_box.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the melon is. Ava moved the melon to the green_basket, so she knows where it is. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle, so she also knows where it is. Mila and Liam made no movements and did not see where the melon was moved to, so they do not know where it is. William also made no movements and did not see where the melon was moved to, so he also does not know where it is.

Now, we need to determine who Ella thinks Mila thinks William thinks the melon is. Since Mila did not see where the melon was moved to, she cannot have an opinion on where William thinks the melon is. Therefore, Ella cannot think that Mila thinks William thinks the melon is in any specific location.

So the answer is none of the above, as Ella cannot have an opinion on where Mila thinks William thinks the melon is.
