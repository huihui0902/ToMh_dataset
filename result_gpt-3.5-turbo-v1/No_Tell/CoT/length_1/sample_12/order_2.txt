First, Mila entered the garden with the others. Then, she made no movements and stayed in the garden for 1 minute before exiting. During this time, Ava moved the melon to the green_basket. Liam made no movements and stayed in the garden for 1 minute before exiting. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle before exiting. Finally, William made no movements and stayed in the garden for 1 minute before exiting. 

Based on the assumptions given, Mila can only infer William's thought if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. Mila did not move the melon, so she does not know where it is. She also did not see William move the melon or have any interactions with him. Therefore, Mila cannot infer where William thinks the melon is. 

The answer is none of the above (N/A).
