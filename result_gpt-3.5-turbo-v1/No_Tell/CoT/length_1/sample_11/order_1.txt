1. Chloe, Benjamin, Alexander, Ella and Elizabeth entered the study.
2. The orange is in the red_box.
3. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
4. Alexander lost his phone.
5. Chloe exited the study.
6. Benjamin moved the orange to the red_envelope.
7. Benjamin exited the study.
8. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
9. Alexander exited the study.
10. Ella made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
11. Benjamin saw a cat.
12. Ella exited the study.
13. Elizabeth moved the orange to the red_box.
14. Elizabeth exited the study.
15. Chloe, Benjamin, Alexander, Ella and Elizabeth entered the waiting_room.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer the following:

- Chloe did not move the orange and left the study before Benjamin moved it to the red_envelope.
- Alexander did not move the orange and left the study after Benjamin moved it to the red_envelope.
- Ella did not move the orange and left the study after Alexander.
- Elizabeth moved the orange to the red_box before leaving the study.

Therefore, Ella must have seen the orange in the red_box before leaving the study. So the answer is F. red_box.
