First, we need to determine where the orange actually is. According to statement 2, the orange is in the red_box.

Next, we need to figure out who knows where the orange is. Chloe was in the study for only a minute and made no movements, so she may not have seen where the orange was. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for a minute, so he may not have seen where the orange was either. Benjamin moved the orange to the red_envelope, but he exited the study before Elizabeth moved the orange to the red_box. Ella made no movements and stayed in the study for a minute, so she may not have seen where the orange was. Elizabeth moved the orange to the red_box, so she knows where it is.

Now, we need to determine who Elizabeth may have communicated with or observed to infer where Ella thinks the orange is. Elizabeth was the last to exit the study, so she may trust the exit order and believe that Ella exited before her. However, there is no information about whether Elizabeth and Ella had any private or public interactions that would allow Elizabeth to infer where Ella thinks the orange is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks the orange is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
