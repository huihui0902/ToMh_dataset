First, Mila moved the watermelon to the red_box, so it is not in the blue_cupboard anymore. Then, Ava moved the watermelon to the green_bottle. However, we don't know if Ava saw Mila moving the watermelon to the red_box or not. Emily then moved the watermelon to the blue_bathtub, but again, we don't know if Ava saw this or not. 

Based on assumption (2), Ava can only infer where the watermelon is if she had private or public interactions with Mila or Emily. We don't have any information about this, so we cannot eliminate any options based on this assumption. 

Based on assumption (3), we cannot trust what Ava says to others about where the watermelon is. 

Based on assumption (4), we know that Ava would tend to trust Emily more than Mila because Emily exited the front_yard after Ava did. Therefore, if Ava saw Emily move the watermelon to the blue_bathtub, she would be more likely to believe that the watermelon is in the blue_bathtub. 

Therefore, the answer is A. blue_bathtub.
