1. Mila, Ava, Emily, Evelyn, and Jacob entered the front yard.
2. The watermelon is in the blue cupboard.
3. Mila moved the watermelon to the red box.
4. Mila exited the front yard.
5. Ava moved the watermelon to the green bottle.
6. Ava exited the front yard.
7. Emily moved the watermelon to the blue bathtub.
8. Emily exited the front yard.
9. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
10. Evelyn exited the front yard.
11. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
12. Jacob exited the front yard.
13. Mila, Ava, Emily, Evelyn, and Jacob entered the waiting room.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer that Mila moved the watermelon to the red box, and Ava moved it to the green bottle. However, we cannot trust their claims as they tend to lie. Emily moved the watermelon to the blue bathtub, but we don't know if she was telling the truth or not. Evelyn and Jacob made no movements, so they didn't move the watermelon.

Therefore, we can conclude that the watermelon is either in the green bottle or the red box. However, we cannot determine the exact location of the watermelon as we cannot trust the claims of the agents. So, the answer is either D. green_bottle or E. red_box.
