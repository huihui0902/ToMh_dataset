First, Mila moved the watermelon to the red_box and then exited the front_yard. Then, Ava moved the watermelon to the green_bottle and exited the front_yard. Finally, Emily moved the watermelon to the blue_bathtub and exited the front_yard. 

Evelyn and Jacob made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute before exiting. 

Based on the assumptions given, Emily can only infer Jacob's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Since Jacob made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute before exiting, it is possible that Emily and Jacob had a private or public interaction during that time. 

However, we do not have any information about what Ava thinks about the watermelon's location. Therefore, we cannot determine where Emily thinks Jacob thinks Ava thinks the watermelon is. 

The answer is: Not enough information is given to answer the question.
