14. Logan, Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Charlotte can only infer Logan's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. However, Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, so Charlotte cannot infer Logan's thoughts.

We also know that Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle, so she knows where the potato is. However, we don't know where Benjamin thinks the potato is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks Logan thinks the potato is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
