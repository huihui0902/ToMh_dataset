1. Logan, Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the patio.
2. The potato is in the green_envelope.
3. Charlotte likes the red_bottle.
4. Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
5. Logan exited the patio.
6. Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle.
7. Charlotte exited the patio.
8. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.

11. Benjamin exited the patio.
12. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
13. Evelyn exited the patio.
14. Logan, Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the waiting_room.

Based on the given assumptions, we can infer that Logan did not see Charlotte move the potato to the red_bottle since he made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Logan's exit order is not relevant to the location of the potato.

Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle, but we do not know if she told anyone about it. Since private communication cannot be overheard, we cannot infer if anyone else knows about the potato's new location.

Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, they did not see Charlotte move the potato to the red_bottle.

Based on the given information, we can only conclude that the potato was in the green_envelope when Logan, Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the patio. We cannot determine its current location with certainty. Therefore, the answer is A. green_pantry.
