1. Logan entered the patio with Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn.
2. The potato is in the green_envelope, but we don't know if Logan knows this.
3. Charlotte likes the red_bottle, but we don't know if Logan knows this or if it's relevant to the location of the potato.
4. Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, which could suggest he was observing the surroundings and potentially the location of the potato.
5. Logan exited the patio, but we don't know if he saw or interacted with the potato before leaving.
6. Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle, but we don't know if Logan saw this happen or if he was aware of the potato's original location.
7. Charlotte exited the patio, so Logan may trust her more than the other agents who exited after her.
8. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, which could suggest she was also observing the surroundings and potentially the location of the potato.
9. Hannah exited the patio, but we don't know if she saw or interacted with the potato before leaving.
10. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, which could suggest he was also observing the surroundings and potentially the location of the potato.
11. Benjamin exited the patio, but we don't know if he saw or interacted with the potato before leaving.
12. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, which could suggest she was also observing the surroundings and potentially the location of the potato.
13. Evelyn exited the patio, but we don't know if she saw or interacted with the potato before leaving.
14. Logan, Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the waiting_room, but we don't know if Logan had any further interactions or observations that could affect his knowledge of the potato's location.

Based on the information given, we cannot definitively determine where Logan thinks the potato is. It's possible that he observed its original location in the green_envelope before leaving the patio, or he may have seen Charlotte move it to the red_bottle. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Logan is lying or has a different understanding of the situation. Therefore, the answer to the question is unknown.
