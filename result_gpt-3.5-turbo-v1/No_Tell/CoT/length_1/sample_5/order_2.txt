Based on the assumptions given, we know that Benjamin can only infer Logan's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't affect their actual thought.

From the story, we know that Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. This means that he did not move the potato to the red_bottle, which Charlotte did. Therefore, Benjamin cannot think that Logan thinks the potato is in the red_bottle.

We also know that Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. This means that he did not move the potato either. However, he can infer Logan's thought if they had private or public interactions. But there is no mention of any private or public interactions between Logan and Benjamin in the story.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Benjamin thinks Logan thinks the potato is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
