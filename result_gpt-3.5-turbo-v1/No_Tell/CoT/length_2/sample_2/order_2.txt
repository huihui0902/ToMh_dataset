First, we know that Amelia moved the corn to the red_basket before exiting the hallway. However, we don't know if Lily witnessed this or not. 

Next, we know that Lily moved the melon to the green_pantry before exiting the hallway. This means that she was in the same place as Amelia when Amelia moved the corn to the red_basket. 

According to assumption (2), Lily can infer Amelia's thought about the location of the corn only if they had private or public interactions. We don't have any information about private interactions, but we do know that public claims can be heard by anyone in the same place. 

Since Lily made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute after Amelia moved the corn to the red_basket, it's possible that they had a public interaction during this time. However, we don't have any information about what they said to each other. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
