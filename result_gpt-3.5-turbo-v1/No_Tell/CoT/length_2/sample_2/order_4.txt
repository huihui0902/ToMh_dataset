First, Liam moved the corn to the red_container, so he knows where the corn is. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute, so she doesn't know where the corn is. Lily also made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute, so she doesn't know where the corn is either. Carter made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute, so he doesn't know where the corn is. Amelia moved the corn to the red_basket, but Liam wasn't there to witness it, so he doesn't know where the corn is now.

Next, Liam, Lily, and Carter entered the hallway and Liam moved the melon to the red_basket. So Liam knows that the melon is in the red_basket now. Lily moved the melon to the green_pantry, but Liam wasn't there to witness it, so he doesn't know where the melon is now. Carter moved the melon to the red_container, but Liam doesn't know if he's telling the truth or lying.

Based on the assumptions given, Liam can only infer Sophia's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. However, Sophia made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute, so Liam doesn't know what she thinks about the corn. Lily also made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute, so Liam doesn't know what she thinks about the corn either. Amelia moved the corn to the red_basket, but Liam wasn't there to witness it, so he doesn't know what she thinks about the corn either.

Therefore, Liam doesn't know where Sophia thinks Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is. The answer is none of the above.
