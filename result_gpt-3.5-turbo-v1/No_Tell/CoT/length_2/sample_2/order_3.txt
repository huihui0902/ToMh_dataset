First, we need to determine where the corn is. According to the story, the corn is in the red_basket (line 2). 

Next, we need to determine who moved the corn. Liam moved the corn to the red_container (line 3), and then Amelia moved the corn back to the red_basket (line 11). 

Now, we need to consider Sophia's movements and thoughts. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute (line 5), and then she exited the hallway (line 6). We don't have any information about Sophia's thoughts on the corn. 

Next, we need to consider Lily's movements and thoughts. Lily made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute (line 7), and then she exited the hallway (line 8). We don't have any information about Lily's thoughts on the corn. 

Finally, we need to consider Amelia's thoughts on the corn. We don't have any information about Amelia's thoughts on the corn, but we do know that she moved the corn back to the red_basket (line 11). 

Based on the assumptions given, we cannot infer where Sophia thinks Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given. The correct answer is not applicable.
