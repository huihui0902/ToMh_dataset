1. Sophia, Jackson, Amelia, Charlotte, and Nathan entered the laundry.
2. The tomato is in the blue_container.
3. Sophia moved the tomato to the blue_cupboard.
4. Sophia exited the laundry.
5. Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate.
6. Jackson exited the laundry.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Jackson witnessed Sophia moving the tomato to the blue cupboard, but he moved it to the blue crate after she left. Therefore, he must have thought that the tomato was in the blue crate.

The answer is L. blue_crate.
