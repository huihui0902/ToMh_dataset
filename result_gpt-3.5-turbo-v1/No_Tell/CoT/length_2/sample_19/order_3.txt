12. Nathan exited the laundry.

From the story, we know that Nathan moved the tomato to the blue_container, but we don't know if Amelia witnessed this movement or not. We also don't know if Nathan and Jackson had any private or public interactions that would allow Amelia to infer Nathan's thoughts about where Jackson thinks the tomato is.

13. Sophia, Jackson, Amelia, Charlotte, and Nathan entered the waiting_room.
14. Nathan, Jackson, and Amelia entered the hall.
15. The onion is in the blue_treasure_chest.

21. Jackson saw a mouse.
22. Amelia exited the hall.
23. Jackson lost his phone.
24. Nathan, Jackson, and Amelia entered the waiting_room.

From the story, we know that the onion is in the blue_treasure_chest, but we don't know if Amelia witnessed this movement or not. We also don't know if Amelia and Nathan had any private or public interactions that would allow Amelia to infer Nathan's thoughts about where Jackson thinks the tomato is.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that Amelia can only infer Nathan's thoughts about where Jackson thinks the tomato is if they had private or public interactions. We also know that Amelia tends to lie, so her claims about what she thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks about the tomato's location may not be accurate.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is with the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
