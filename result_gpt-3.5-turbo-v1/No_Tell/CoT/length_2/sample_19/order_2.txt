1. Sophia, Jackson, Amelia, Charlotte and Nathan entered the laundry.
2. The tomato is in the blue_container.
3. Sophia moved the tomato to the blue_cupboard.
4. Sophia exited the laundry.
5. Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate.
6. Jackson exited the laundry.
7. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
8. Amelia exited the laundry.
9. Charlotte made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
10. Charlotte exited the laundry.
11. Nathan moved the tomato to the blue_container.
12. Nathan exited the laundry.

Based on assumption (4), Nathan trusts Jackson's opinion more than Sophia's because Jackson exited the laundry after Sophia. Therefore, Nathan thinks that Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_crate.

The answer is L. blue_crate.
