1. Sophia moved the tomato to the blue_cupboard before exiting the laundry.
2. Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate after Sophia left.
3. Nathan moved the tomato back to the blue_container after Jackson left.
4. Amelia and Charlotte made no movements in the laundry.

6. Amelia moved the onion to the green_cupboard before leaving the hall.
7. Jackson lost his phone and Nathan, Jackson, and Amelia entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, Sophia can only infer Amelia's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. However, there is no information given that Sophia and Amelia had any interactions or were in the same place at any point in the story. Therefore, it is impossible to determine where Sophia thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
