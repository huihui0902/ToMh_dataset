1. Sophia, Jackson, Amelia, Charlotte, and Nathan entered the laundry.
2. The tomato is in the blue_container.
3. Sophia moved the tomato to the blue_cupboard.
4. Sophia exited the laundry.
5. Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate.
6. Jackson exited the laundry.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Sophia witnessed Jackson moving the tomato to the blue_crate before she exited the laundry. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie according to assumption (3), so we cannot trust what Sophia or Jackson said about the tomato's location.

7. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
8. Amelia exited the laundry.
9. Charlotte made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
10. Charlotte exited the laundry.
11. Nathan moved the tomato to the blue_container.
12. Nathan exited the laundry.

Based on assumption (4), we can trust Nathan's claim about the tomato's location since he exited the laundry last. Therefore, the tomato is in the blue_container.

13. Sophia, Jackson, Amelia, Charlotte, and Nathan entered the waiting_room.
