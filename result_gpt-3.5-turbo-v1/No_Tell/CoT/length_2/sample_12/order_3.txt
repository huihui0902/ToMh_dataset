Based on the assumptions given, we know that Ava can only infer Alexander's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

From the story, we know that Ava and Alexander were both in the office together, and that Alexander moved the asparagus to the red_drawer. However, there is no mention of Charlotte or the pear in the office scene.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Ava thinks Alexander thinks Charlotte thinks the pear is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
