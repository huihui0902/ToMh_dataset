Based on the assumptions given, we know that Alexander can only infer Charlotte's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say. 

From the story, we know that Charlotte moved the pear to the red_bucket in the pantry, but we don't know if Alexander was present in the pantry at that time. We also know that Alexander moved the asparagus to the red_drawer in the office, and Charlotte later moved it to the red_pantry. 

Therefore, we can infer that Alexander thinks Charlotte thinks the asparagus is in the red_pantry, not the pear. The answer is E. red_pantry.
