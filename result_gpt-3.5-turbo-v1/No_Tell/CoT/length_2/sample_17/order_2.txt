First, we need to determine where the lime actually is. According to the story, Lily moved the lime from the red_bottle to the blue_drawer, and then Evelyn moved it to the green_pantry. Therefore, the lime is in the green_pantry.

Next, we need to determine what information Emily has about Owen's thoughts. According to the story, Emily made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute, while Owen made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Emily and Owen were in the same place at the same time, and Emily could have inferred Owen's thoughts if they had any interactions.

However, there is no information in the story about Emily and Owen having any interactions or conversations. Therefore, we cannot determine what Emily thinks Owen thinks about the location of the lime. The answer is unknown.
