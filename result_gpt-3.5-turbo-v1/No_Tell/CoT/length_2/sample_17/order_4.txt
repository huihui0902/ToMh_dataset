First, we need to determine where the lime actually is. According to assumption (1), we know that Lily moved the lime to the blue_drawer. Therefore, the lime is in the blue_drawer.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the lime is. According to the story, Lily, Evelyn, and Emily were the only ones who moved the lime. Lily exited the front_yard before anyone else, so she did not have a chance to tell anyone where she moved the lime. Evelyn and Emily both exited the front-yard after Lily, so they could have potentially told someone where they moved the lime. However, we do not have any information about them telling anyone else where they moved the lime.

Now, we need to determine who Ella thinks knows where the lime is. According to assumption (2), Ella can only infer what someone else knows if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Ella was in the front-yard with Lily, Evelyn, and Emily, so she knows that they were the only ones who could have potentially moved the lime. However, we do not have any information about them having any private or public interactions about the lime.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Ella thinks Lily thinks Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
