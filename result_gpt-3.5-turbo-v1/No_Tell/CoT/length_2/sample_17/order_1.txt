1. Lily, Ella, Owen, Evelyn and Emily entered the front_yard.
2. Ella likes the red_bottle.
3. The lime is in the red_bottle.
4. Lily moved the lime to the blue_drawer.
5. Lily exited the front_yard.
6. Ella made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.
7. Ella exited the front_yard.
8. Owen made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.
9. Owen exited the front_yard.

Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Owen tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. Since Lily exited the front-yard before Owen, he may not trust her completely. However, he did not make any movements in the front-yard, so he did not have any private or public interactions with any other agents. Therefore, we cannot infer where Owen thinks the lime is based on the information given. The answer is unknown.
