1. Lily moved the lime to the blue_drawer, so she knows where the lime is.
2. Lily made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute, so she didn't witness any movements after she left the blue_drawer.
3. Emily made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute, so she didn't witness any movements after Lily left the blue_drawer.
4. Owen made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute, so he didn't witness any movements after Emily left the front_yard.
5. Lily, Emily, and Ella entered the waiting_room together, so they could have had private communication about the lime's location.
6. Ella moved the lettuce to the green_cupboard, so she knows where the lettuce is.
7. Lily lost his phone in the attic, so she might have been distracted and not paying attention to the lime's location.

Based on these assumptions, Lily might think that Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the green_pantry (option B) because Emily was in the attic with Lily and Ella, and they could have had a private conversation about the lime's location. However, this is just a guess and cannot be confirmed with certainty.
