First, we need to determine where the watermelon actually is. According to statement 2, the watermelon is in the blue suitcase. 

Next, we need to determine who moved the watermelon and where it was moved to. According to statements 5 and 8, Sophia and Carter both moved the watermelon. Sophia moved it to the green envelope, and Carter moved it to the green basket. 

Now, we need to determine who Isla thinks Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is. According to statement 7, Avery dislikes tomatoes, but there is no information about Avery's thoughts on watermelon. 

Since Isla and Avery were both in the sunroom together, Isla can infer Avery's thoughts based on his actions. According to statement 22, Avery made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute. This means that he did not move the watermelon or express any thoughts about its location. 

However, we know that Carter likes the green treasure chest (statement 15), and he moved the watermelon to the green basket (statement 8). Therefore, Isla may think that Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is in the green basket. 

Therefore, the answer is D. green basket.
