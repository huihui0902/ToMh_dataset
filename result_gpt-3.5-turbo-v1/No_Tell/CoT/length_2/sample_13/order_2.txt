1. Avery entered the workshop with Sophia, Carter, Emily, and Isla.
2. The watermelon was initially in the blue suitcase.
3. Avery made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute.
4. Avery exited the workshop.
5. Sophia moved the watermelon to the green envelope.
6. Sophia exited the workshop.
7. Avery dislikes the tomato.
8. Carter moved the watermelon to the green basket.
9. Carter exited the workshop.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Avery can only infer Carter's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that Avery tends to lie, so we cannot trust what Avery says.

Avery was in the workshop with Carter when the watermelon was moved from the blue suitcase to the green envelope and then to the green basket. However, Avery made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Avery did not witness Carter moving the watermelon to the green basket.

Since Avery dislikes the tomato, we can assume that he was not paying attention to what was happening with the watermelon. Therefore, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
