Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Nathan can only trust the thoughts of Isabella and Evelyn, as they exited the cellar after him. We also know that Lily dislikes the cucumber and Ava dislikes the spinach, but this information does not help us determine where Nathan thinks the melon is.

From the story, we know that the melon was initially in the blue_container, but Evelyn moved it to the green_treasure_chest. Nathan then moved the melon to the blue_treasure_chest. However, we do not know if Nathan thinks the melon is still in the blue_treasure_chest or if he moved it again.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Where does Nathan really think the melon is?" cannot be determined from the given information.
