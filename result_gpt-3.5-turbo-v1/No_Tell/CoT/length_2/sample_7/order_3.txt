First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to the story, the melon was initially in the blue_container, but then Evelyn moved it to the green_treasure_chest, and then Nathan moved it to the blue_treasure_chest. So, the melon is currently in the blue_treasure_chest.

Next, we need to determine what Lily thinks about the melon's location. There is no information in the story about Lily's thoughts on the melon's location, so we cannot determine this.

However, we do know that Isabella made no movements in the hallway and stayed there for 1 minute, while Lily made no movements in the hallway and stayed there for 1 minute as well. This means that Isabella and Lily were in the same place at the same time, so they could have had a private or public interaction.

Since we do not have any information about Lily's thoughts on the melon's location, we cannot determine what Isabella thinks Lily thinks Nathan thinks the melon is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information.
