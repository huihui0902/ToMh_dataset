1. Noah and Emma entered the staircase together.
2. There is a cabbage in the green_envelope.
3. Noah moved the cabbage to the green_box.
4. Emma likes the red_envelope.
5. Noah exited the staircase.
6. Emma made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
7. Emma exited the staircase.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Noah can only infer Emma's thoughts if they have had private or public interactions. However, there is no indication in the story that they had any interactions while in the staircase. Therefore, we cannot determine where Noah thinks Emma thinks Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is. The answer is unknown.
