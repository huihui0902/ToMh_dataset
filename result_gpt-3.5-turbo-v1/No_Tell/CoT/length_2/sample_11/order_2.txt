1. Emily moved the cherry to the red_container before exiting the pantry.
2. Lily made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute before exiting.
3. Emma moved the cherry to the green_envelope before exiting the pantry.
4. Avery moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase before exiting the pantry.
5. Ella made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute before exiting.
6. Lily, Avery, and Ella entered the cellar and Avery moved the tomato to the red_bucket.
7. Lily likes the red_drawer.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Lily can only infer Avery's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that Lily tends to lie, so we cannot trust what she says.

There is no information given that suggests Lily and Avery had any private or public interactions, so we can only assume that Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is in the same place that he left it, which is the blue_suitcase. Therefore, the answer is H. blue_suitcase.
