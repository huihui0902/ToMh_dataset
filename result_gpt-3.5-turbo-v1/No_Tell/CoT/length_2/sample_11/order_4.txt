First, Emily moved the cherry from the red_drawer to the red_container. So, she knows that the cherry is in the red_container. 

Next, Lily and Ella made no movements in the pantry, so they don't know where the cherry is. 

Then, Emma moved the cherry from the red_container to the green_envelope, and Avery moved it from there to the blue_suitcase. So, Emily knows that Avery thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase. 

However, Emily doesn't know what Lily or Ella think about the cherry's location. 

Since Lily and Ella were in the cellar with Avery, they could have heard Avery say where he put the cherry. But since Lily made no movements in the cellar and Ella made no movements in the pantry, they don't know where the cherry is for sure. 

Therefore, Emily cannot infer where Ella thinks Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is. The answer is none of the above.
