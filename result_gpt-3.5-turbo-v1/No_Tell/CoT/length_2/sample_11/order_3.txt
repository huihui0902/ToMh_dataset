3. Emma moved the cherry to the green_envelope before exiting the pantry.

5. Ella made no movements in the pantry and stayed there for 1 minute before exiting.
6. Lily, Avery, and Ella entered the cellar and Avery moved the tomato to the red_bucket.
7. Lily likes the red_drawer.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Ella can only infer Lily's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say.

Since Ella and Lily were both in the pantry, Ella can infer Lily's thoughts about the cherry. However, we do not know if they had any private or public interactions about it. We also do not know if Avery and Lily had any interactions about the cherry.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Ella thinks Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
