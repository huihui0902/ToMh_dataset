1. Ava entered the dining_room and made no movements before exiting. We don't have any information about her knowing the location of the cucumber.
2. Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red_envelope before exiting the dining_room. However, we know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust her claim about the location of the cucumber.
3. Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_crate before exiting the dining_room. Again, we cannot trust her claim.
4. William made no movements in the dining_room before exiting, so we don't have any information about his knowledge of the cucumber's location.
5. Jacob moved the cucumber to the green_treasure_chest before exiting the dining_room. We don't have any reason to doubt his claim, as he exited the room after Charlotte, who we assume he trusts.

Therefore, based on the given information, the cucumber is most likely in the green_treasure_chest (option D).
