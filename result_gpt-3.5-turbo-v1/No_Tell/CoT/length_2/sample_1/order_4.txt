First, we need to determine where the cucumber actually is. According to statement 2, the cucumber is in the green treasure chest. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the cucumber is. Ava was in the dining room when the cucumber was moved, but she made no movements and did not witness any of the movements. Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red envelope, but she left before Charlotte moved it to the red crate. William was in the dining room but made no movements and did not witness any of the movements. Jacob moved the cucumber back to the green treasure chest, but he did not witness any of the previous movements. 

Therefore, only Charlotte knows where the cucumber was moved to last, which is the red crate. 

Now we need to determine who Jacob thinks Charlotte thinks Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the cucumber is. Since Jacob moved the cucumber back to the green treasure chest, we can assume that he thinks the cucumber is still there. 

Charlotte knows that the cucumber was moved to the red crate, so she does not think it is in the green treasure chest. 

Ava did not witness any of the movements, so she does not have any information about where the cucumber is. 

Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red envelope, but she left before Charlotte moved it to the red crate. Therefore, Charlotte does not think that Evelyn thinks the cucumber is in the red envelope. 

Based on these assumptions, we can conclude that Jacob thinks Charlotte thinks Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the cucumber is in the green treasure chest (option D).
