Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Mila moved the potato to the red_basket and Isabella moved the potato to the green_bottle. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust their claims. 

We also know that Jacob exited the crawlspace last, so we can assume that he is more trustworthy than the others. Jacob moved the potato to the blue_drawer, so the answer is B. blue_drawer.
