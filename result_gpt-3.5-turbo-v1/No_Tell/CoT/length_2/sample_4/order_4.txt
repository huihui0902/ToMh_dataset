First, we need to determine where the potato is. According to statement 2, the potato is in the blue_drawer.

Next, we need to determine who moved the potato and where it ended up. According to statement 7, Mila moved the potato to the red_basket. Therefore, the potato is no longer in the blue_drawer.

Now, we need to determine who Jacob thinks Evelyn thinks Chloe thinks Isabella thinks the potato is. Since Jacob was the last one to exit the closet, he would tend to trust the thoughts of Evelyn and Mila more than Chloe and Isabella. 

According to statement 3, Evelyn made no movements while in the crawlspace, so she did not move the potato. Mila moved the potato to the red_basket, so it is possible that Jacob thinks Evelyn thinks Mila thinks the potato is in the red_basket.

However, we cannot determine what Chloe or Isabella think about the location of the potato, as they did not move it and there is no information about their thoughts.

Therefore, the answer is D. red_basket.
