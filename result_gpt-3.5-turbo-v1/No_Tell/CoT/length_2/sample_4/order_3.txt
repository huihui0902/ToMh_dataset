First, we need to determine where the potato actually is. According to statement 2, the potato is in the blue_drawer. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the potato is. Mila moved the potato to the red_basket, so she knows where it is. Isabella moved it to the green_bottle, so she also knows where it is. Jacob moved it back to the blue_drawer, so he knows where it is as well. 

Evelyn and Chloe did not move the potato, so we don't know if they know where it is. However, we do know that Evelyn moved the watermelon to the blue_suitcase, so she knows where the watermelon is. 

Now we need to determine who Evelyn thinks Chloe thinks Isabella thinks the potato is. Since we don't know if Chloe knows where the potato is, we can't use that information. However, we do know that Isabella moved the potato to the green_bottle. 

Based on this information, Evelyn could think that Chloe thinks Isabella thinks the potato is in the green_bottle. Therefore, the answer is C. green_bottle.
