1. Evelyn, Chloe, Mila, Isabella and Jacob entered the crawlspace.
2. The potato is in the blue_drawer.
3. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
4. Evelyn exited the crawlspace.
5. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
6. Chloe exited the crawlspace.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Chloe cannot infer Isabella's thought about the location of the potato because they have not been in the same place or had any private or public interactions. Therefore, we cannot determine where Chloe thinks Isabella thinks the potato is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
