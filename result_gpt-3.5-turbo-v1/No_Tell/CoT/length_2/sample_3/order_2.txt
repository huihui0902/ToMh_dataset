First, we need to identify where Benjamin was when the peas were being moved around. According to the story, Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute. Therefore, Benjamin was in the workshop when the peas were being moved around.

Next, we need to identify which agents were in the workshop with Benjamin when the peas were being moved around. According to the story, Liam, Noah, Avery, Mila, and Benjamin entered the workshop. Liam, Noah, and Avery exited the workshop, leaving only Mila and Benjamin in the workshop when the peas were moved to the blue_crate.

Since Noah was not in the workshop when the peas were being moved around, he would not have witnessed where the peas were moved to. Therefore, he would not have any direct knowledge of where Benjamin thinks the peas are.

However, we can make an inference based on assumption (2) that if Noah and Benjamin had any private or public interactions, Noah may be able to infer where Benjamin thinks the peas are. But there is no information in the story to suggest that Noah and Benjamin had any interactions.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas are. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
