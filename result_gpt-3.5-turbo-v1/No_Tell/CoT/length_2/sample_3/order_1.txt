Based on the assumptions given, we know that Benjamin cannot infer where the peas is based on what the other agents have said or done, as he did not witness any of the movements of the peas. Additionally, we know that Benjamin tends to lie, so we cannot trust any public claims he may make.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Benjamin really thinks the peas is. The answer is not provided in the story and cannot be inferred based on the given information. The correct answer is not listed among the multiple-choice options.
