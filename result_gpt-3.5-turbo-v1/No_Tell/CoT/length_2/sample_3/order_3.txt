First, Liam moved the peas from the green_drawer to the blue_container and dislikes the peas. Then, Noah moved the peas to the green_crate. Avery moved the peas to the blue_bucket, and Mila moved the peas to the blue_crate. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute. 

Based on assumption (4), Liam would trust Mila's claim about the location of the peas since she exited the workshop after him. Mila moved the melon to the blue_suitcase in the den, but this question is about where Liam thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is. 

There is no information about Noah and Benjamin having any private or public interactions, so Liam cannot infer what Benjamin thinks about the location of the peas. Therefore, Liam cannot think about where Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is. 

The answer is none of the above, as Liam cannot make any assumptions about where Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is.
