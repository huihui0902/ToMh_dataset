First, Liam moved the peas from the green_drawer to the blue_container and dislikes the peas. So, Liam thinks the peas are in the blue_container.

Then, Noah moved the peas from the blue_container to the green_crate. We don't know what Noah thinks about the location of the peas.

After that, Avery moved the peas from the green_crate to the blue_bucket. We don't know what Avery thinks about the location of the peas, but we know that Avery thinks the peas are in the blue_bucket.

Mila then moved the peas from the blue_bucket to the blue_crate. We don't know what Mila thinks about the location of the peas.

Finally, Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute, so we don't know what Benjamin thinks about the location of the peas.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Avery can only infer what Liam thinks about the location of the peas if Avery and Liam have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that Avery tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself, and we know that Liam exited the workshop before Avery.

Therefore, Avery may think that Liam thinks the peas are in the blue_container, since Liam moved the peas there and exited the workshop before Avery. However, we don't know what Noah or Benjamin think about the location of the peas, so we cannot infer what Avery thinks they think.

So, the answer is D. blue_cupboard is not a valid option based on the story and assumptions given.
