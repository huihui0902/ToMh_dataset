Based on the given assumptions, we know that Nathan can only infer the location of the peas based on his own observations and the observations of agents who exited the kitchen after him. Since Nathan was the last agent to exit the kitchen, he can trust the observations of Avery and Evelyn, who exited the kitchen before him. Therefore, Nathan really thinks that the peas is in the blue_suitcase, which is where he moved it to before leaving the bathroom. The answer is A. blue_suitcase.
