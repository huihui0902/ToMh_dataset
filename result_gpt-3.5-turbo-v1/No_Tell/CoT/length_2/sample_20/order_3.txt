1. Emily moved the peas to the red_basket.
2. Ella moved the peas to the red_envelope.
3. Avery moved the peas to the blue_cupboard.
4. Nathan moved the peas to the blue_suitcase.

Based on assumption (2), Ella can only infer Nathan's thought about the location of the peas if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. According to the story, both Ella and Nathan were in the bathroom together, so Ella could have inferred Nathan's thought about the location of the peas.

However, we need to determine where Ella thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas is. We know that Emily moved the peas to the red_basket, but we don't know if she communicated this to Nathan or if Nathan saw her move the peas. Therefore, Ella cannot infer Nathan's thought about the location of the peas based on Emily's actions alone.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Ella thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas is. The answer is not provided in the story. The correct answer is not listed among the options given.
