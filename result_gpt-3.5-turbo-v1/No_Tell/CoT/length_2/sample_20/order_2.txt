First, we need to determine where the peas actually are. According to the story, the peas were initially in the blue suitcase, then moved to the red basket by Emily, then to the red envelope by Ella, then to the blue cupboard by Avery, and finally back to the blue suitcase by Nathan. So, the peas are in the blue suitcase.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the peas are. Emily, Ella, Avery, and Nathan all moved the peas at some point, so they all know where the peas are. Evelyn, however, did not move the peas and only spent one minute in the bathroom and one minute in the kitchen, so it's unclear if she knows where the peas are.

Now, we need to determine who Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas is. Emily moved the peas to the red basket, so she knows they are not there anymore. She also exited the bathroom before Ella and Avery, so she may not know that the peas were moved to the red envelope and blue cupboard before being returned to the blue suitcase by Nathan. However, she may have heard Nathan claim that he moved the peas back to the blue suitcase when he exited the bathroom after her.

Based on this, Emily may think that Nathan thinks the peas are still in the red basket, since he may not have known that they were moved to the red envelope and blue cupboard before being returned to the blue suitcase. Therefore, the answer is D. red_basket.
