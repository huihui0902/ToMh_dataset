Based on the assumptions given, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say. We also know that an agent can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Therefore, we cannot infer the location of the orange based on what the agents say.

However, we do know that the orange was initially in the red_pantry, and Jack moved it to the blue_treasure_chest, and Chloe moved it to the red_container. Therefore, the orange is currently in the red_container. 

The answer is A. red_container.
