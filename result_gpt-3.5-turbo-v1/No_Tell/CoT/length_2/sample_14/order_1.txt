First, we know that the lemon was initially in the red_box, but Evelyn moved it to the red_container before leaving the hall. Isla made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute before leaving. Therefore, Isla should know that the lemon was in the red_container when she left the hall. 

However, we don't know if Isla had any private or public interactions with any other agents who may have lied to her about the location of the lemon. We also don't know if Isla trusts any of the other agents who exited the hall after her. 

Based on the given information, we cannot determine where Isla really thinks the lemon is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given options.
