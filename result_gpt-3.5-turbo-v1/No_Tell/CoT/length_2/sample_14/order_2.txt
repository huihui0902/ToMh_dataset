1. Evelyn, Isla, Alexander, Emma, and Sophia entered the hall.
2. The lemon is in the red_box.
3. Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container.
4. Evelyn exited the hall.
5. Isla made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute.
6. Isla exited the hall.

Based on the assumptions, Sophia cannot infer where the lemon is because she did not witness any movements related to the lemon. Therefore, Sophia cannot have any thoughts about where Isla thinks the lemon is. The answer is none of the above.
