First, we need to determine where the lemon is. According to statement 2, the lemon is in the red_box. 

Next, we need to determine who moved the lemon and where it was moved to. According to statement 3, Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container. However, we are interested in where Alexander thinks Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is. 

We know that Isla made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute, so she did not move the lemon. Sophia also made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute, so she did not move the lemon either. 

According to statement 7, Alexander moved the lemon to the green_treasure_chest. However, we are interested in where Alexander thinks Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is. We know that Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container, but we do not know what she thinks about where the lemon is. 

Since we do not have any information about what Evelyn thinks about the location of the lemon, we cannot determine where Alexander thinks Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
