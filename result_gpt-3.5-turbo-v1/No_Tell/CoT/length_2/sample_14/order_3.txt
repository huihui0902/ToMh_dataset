First, we need to determine where the lemon is currently located. According to statement 3, Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container. Therefore, the lemon is in the red_container.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the lemon is. Isla made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute, so she did not see where the lemon was moved. Alexander moved the lemon to the green_treasure_chest, so he knows the lemon is not in the red_container. Emma moved the lemon to the green_bottle, so she also knows the lemon is not in the red_container. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute, so she did not see where the lemon was moved. Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container, so she knows the lemon is in the red_container.

Now, we need to determine who knows where Isla thinks the lemon is. Since Isla did not see where the lemon was moved, she does not know where it is. Therefore, no one can know where Isla thinks the lemon is.

Finally, we need to determine where Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is. Since Isla does not know where the lemon is, no one can know where she thinks it is. Therefore, Evelyn cannot know where Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is. The answer is none of the above (not listed as an option).
