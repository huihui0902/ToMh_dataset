1. Evelyn, Isla, Alexander, Emma and Sophia entered the hall.
2. The lemon is in the red_box.
3. Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container.
4. Evelyn exited the hall.
5. Isla made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute.
6. Isla exited the hall.
7. Alexander moved the lemon to the green_treasure_chest.
8. Alexander exited the hall.
9. Emma moved the lemon to the green_bottle.
