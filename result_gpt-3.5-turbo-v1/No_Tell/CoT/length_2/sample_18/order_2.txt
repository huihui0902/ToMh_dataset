Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Lily can only infer Noah's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't affect their actual thought. 

Noah dislikes the green pepper, but there is no information about his thoughts on the corn. However, we know that Sophia moved the corn to the blue_container, and Lily was in the same place as Sophia before she moved the tomato to the green_drawer. Therefore, Lily could have overheard Sophia's actions and may think that Noah thinks the corn is in the blue_container. 

Therefore, the answer is M. blue_container.
