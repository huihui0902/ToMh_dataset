First, we need to determine where the corn is. According to statement 2, the corn is in the blue_treasure_chest.

Next, we need to determine where Lily thinks the corn is. There is no direct statement about this, but we know that Lily moved the tomato to the green_drawer in statement 22. This statement does not provide any information about what Lily thinks about the location of the corn.

Now we need to determine where Noah thinks the corn is. According to statement 6, Noah dislikes the green_pepper, but there is no information about what he thinks about the corn.

Next, we need to determine where Isla thinks Noah thinks the corn is. There is no direct statement about this, but we know that Isla made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute in statement 5, while Noah made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute in statement 8. This means that Isla and Noah were in the same place at the same time, so Isla could have inferred Noah's thoughts about the corn. However, there is no information about what Isla thinks Noah thinks about the corn.

Finally, we need to determine where Isla thinks Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is. There is no direct statement about this, but we know that Isla, Sophia, and Lily entered the waiting_room together in statement 24. Since Isla exited the front_yard before Lily, she would tend to trust Lily's thoughts more than her own. However, we still don't know what Lily thinks about Noah's thoughts on the location of the corn.

Based on the information given, we cannot determine where Isla thinks Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
