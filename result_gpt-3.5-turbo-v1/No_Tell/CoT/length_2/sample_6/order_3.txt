First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to the story, the melon was initially in the red_pantry, but Owen moved it to the green_basket, and then Mila moved it to the green_box, and finally, Noah moved it to the red_pantry. So, the melon is in the red_pantry at the end.

Next, we need to determine where Benjamin was when Avery saw the monkey. According to the story, Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. So, Benjamin was in the bedroom when Avery saw the monkey.

Now, we need to determine where Owen thinks the melon is. According to the story, Owen likes the red_basket, but he moved the melon to the green_basket. So, it's unclear where Owen thinks the melon is.

Since Avery and Benjamin were both in the bedroom at the same time, they could have had a private or public interaction. However, we don't have any information about their interaction, so we can't determine what Avery thinks Owen thinks about the melon's location.

Therefore, we cannot answer the question. The correct answer is not provided.
