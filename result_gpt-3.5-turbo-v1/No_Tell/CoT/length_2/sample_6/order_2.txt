1. Owen, Avery, Benjamin, Mila and Noah entered the bedroom.
2. The melon is in the red_pantry.
3. Owen moved the melon to the green_basket.
4. Owen exited the bedroom.
5. Avery saw a monkey.
6. Avery made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
7. Avery exited the bedroom.

Based on the assumptions, Avery cannot infer Owen's thought about the melon's location because Avery did not witness Owen moving the melon to the green basket. However, we know that Owen likes the red basket, so it is possible that Avery thinks Owen thinks the melon is in the red basket. Therefore, the answer is A. red_basket.
