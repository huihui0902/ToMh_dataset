1. Owen, Avery, Benjamin, Mila and Noah entered the bedroom.
2. The melon is in the red_pantry.
3. Owen moved the melon to the green_basket.
4. Owen exited the bedroom.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Owen trusts the agent who exited the room later than himself. Since Owen was the first to exit the bedroom, he cannot trust anyone's claim about the location of the melon. Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen really thinks the melon is based on this information. The answer is unknown.
