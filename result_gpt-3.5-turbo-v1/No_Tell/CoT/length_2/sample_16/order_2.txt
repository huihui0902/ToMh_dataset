1. Liam entered the den with Jackson, Carter, Benjamin and Sophia.
2. The tangerine was in the green_bottle.
3. Liam moved the tangerine to the blue_treasure_chest.
4. Liam exited the den.
5. Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red_bucket.
6. Sophia moved the tangerine to the green_bottle.
7. Liam, Jackson, Carter, Benjamin and Sophia entered the waiting_room.
8. Benjamin, Liam and Carter entered the bathroom.
9. The plum was in the blue_suitcase.
10. Benjamin moved the plum to the green_crate.
11. Liam moved the plum to the red_drawer.
12. Liam exited the bathroom.
13. Benjamin, Liam and Carter entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, Liam can only infer Benjamin's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Liam and Benjamin were both in the bathroom together, so Liam could have inferred Benjamin's thought about the tangerine.

According to the story, the tangerine was last moved by Sophia to the green_bottle before Liam, Benjamin, and Carter entered the bathroom. Liam moved the plum to the red_drawer while Benjamin moved the plum to the green_crate. Therefore, Liam may think that Benjamin thinks the tangerine is still in the green_bottle, as that was the last place the tangerine was before they entered the bathroom together. 

Therefore, the answer is L. green_bottle.
