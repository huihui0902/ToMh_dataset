Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Benjamin can only know the true location of the tangerine if he was in the same place as the person who moved it last, or if he had a private interaction with that person. From the story, we know that Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red_bucket, but we don't know if he knows that the tangerine was moved again by Sophia to the green_bottle. 

However, we also know that Benjamin lost his phone, which means he might have had a private conversation with someone about the tangerine's location. Unfortunately, we don't have any information about this conversation, so we cannot determine where Benjamin really thinks the tangerine is.

Therefore, the answer to the question is unknown.
