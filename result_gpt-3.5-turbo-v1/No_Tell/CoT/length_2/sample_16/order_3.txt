First, we need to determine where the tangerine actually is. According to the story, the tangerine was moved several times and ended up in the green bottle, which was moved by Sophia.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the tangerine is. Liam, Jackson, Carter, Benjamin, and Sophia were all in the den when the tangerine was first introduced, so they all know that it was originally in the green bottle. However, after that, the tangerine was moved several times and not everyone witnessed every movement.

Carter made no movements with the tangerine, so he doesn't know where it is currently. Liam moved the tangerine to the blue treasure chest, but then he left the den, so he doesn't know where it is currently either. Jackson moved the tangerine to the green bathtub, but then he also left the den, so he doesn't know where it is currently. Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red bucket, but then he left the den, so he doesn't know where it is currently either. Sophia moved the tangerine to the green bottle, and then she also left the den, so she knows where it is currently.

Now, we need to determine who Carter thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is. Since Carter made no movements with the tangerine and Liam left the den before the tangerine ended up in the green bottle, Carter doesn't know where Liam thinks the tangerine is. However, he does know that Liam exited the den after him, so he might trust Liam's judgment more than Benjamin's.

Since Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red bucket before leaving the den, and Liam left the den before the tangerine ended up in the green bottle, it's unlikely that Carter would think Liam thinks the tangerine is in the red bucket. It's also unlikely that Carter would think Liam thinks the tangerine is in the blue bottle, since Liam never moved the tangerine there.

Based on the available information, it's possible that Carter might think Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the green crate, since Liam might trust Benjamin's judgment and the green crate is the closest location to where the tangerine ended up. However, without more information, it's impossible to say for sure where Carter thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is. Therefore, the answer to the question is not provided in the given assumptions and story.
