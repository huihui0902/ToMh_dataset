Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer that Abigail thinks the corn is in the green_bucket. This is because Abigail was the last one to exit the basement after moving the corn to the green_bucket. Also, since private communication cannot be overheard, we cannot rely on what Abigail told others about the location of the corn. Therefore, the correct answer is E. green_bucket.
