Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Nathan was in the basement with Abigail and saw her move the corn to the green_bucket. However, we don't know what Nathan thinks Abigail thinks about the location of the corn. Nathan may or may not trust Abigail's claim about the location of the corn. Therefore, we cannot determine where Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the corn is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
