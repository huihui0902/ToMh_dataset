1. Sophia entered the front yard with the sweet_potato in the red_box.
2. Sophia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle.
3. Sophia exited the front yard.
4. Later, Hannah publicly claimed that the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle.
5. Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Sophia can only infer Jackson's thought if they had a private interaction. Since Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box, Sophia knows that the sweet_potato is actually in the red_box, not in the green_bottle as claimed by Hannah. Therefore, the answer is K. red_box.
