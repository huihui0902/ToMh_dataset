First, we need to determine where the sweet_potato actually is. According to the story, the sweet_potato was moved by Sophia to the green_bottle, then by Hannah to the green_box, and finally by Jackson to the red_box. Therefore, the sweet_potato is in the red_box.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the sweet_potato is. Hannah publicly claimed that the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle, while Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box. Therefore, Hannah knows that the sweet_potato is not in the green_bottle, but she may or may not know that it is in the red_box.

Now, we need to determine who Hannah thinks Avery thinks Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is. According to the assumptions, Hannah can only infer Avery's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. From the story, we know that Hannah, Jackson, Avery, and Sophia were all in the front_yard at some point, but we don't know if they had any interactions there. However, we do know that Hannah and Avery were both in the basement with Noah and Jackson, and they all entered the waiting_room together. Therefore, Hannah could have inferred Avery's thought about the sweet_potato if Avery had expressed it in the basement or the waiting_room.

Unfortunately, there is no information in the story about Avery's thoughts on the sweet_potato. Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Avery thinks Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is unknown.
