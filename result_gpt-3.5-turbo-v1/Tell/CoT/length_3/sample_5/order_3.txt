First, we need to determine where the sweet_potato actually is. According to the story, it was moved by Sophia to the green_bottle, then by Hannah to the green_box, and finally by Jackson to the red_box. So, the sweet_potato is in the red_box.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the sweet_potato is. Hannah publicly claimed that it is in the green_bottle, but we know that this is not true. Jackson privately told Sophia that it is in the red_box, so we can assume that Sophia knows where it is. However, we don't know if Noah or Avery know where it is.

Now, we need to determine the relationship between Avery and Jackson. They both entered the front_yard and the basement together, but we don't know if they had any private or public interactions. We do know that Avery likes the green_pantry, but we don't know if this is relevant to the location of the sweet_potato.

Finally, we need to determine where Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is. Since we know that Sophia knows where it is, we can assume that Jackson trusts her and believes that she knows where it is. However, we don't have any information about where Sophia thinks it is, so we can't determine where Jackson thinks she thinks it is.

Therefore, we cannot answer the question as there is not enough information given in the story and assumptions to determine where Avery thinks Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is.
