First, we need to determine where the sweet_potato actually is. According to the story, it was moved by Sophia to the green_bottle, then by Hannah to the green_box, and finally by Jackson to the red_box. So, the sweet_potato is in the red_box.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the sweet_potato is. Hannah publicly claimed that it is in the green_bottle, but we know that this is not true. Jackson privately told Sophia that it is in the red_box, so we can assume that Sophia knows where it is as well.

Now, we need to determine where Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is. We know that Jackson privately told Sophia where it is, so he knows that she knows where it is. However, we don't have any information about where he thinks she thinks it is.

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Jackson may trust Sophia more because she exited the front_yard after him. However, we don't have any information about whether they had any private or public interactions that would give Jackson a clue about where Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is not given in the options provided.
