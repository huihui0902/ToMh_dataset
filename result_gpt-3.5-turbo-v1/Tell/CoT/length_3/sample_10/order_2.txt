1. Emily moved the persimmon to the red_envelope.
2. Mila moved the persimmon to the green_box.
3. Charlotte moved the persimmon to the green_bathtub.
4. Emily privately told Benjamin that the apple is in the green_bottle.

Based on the assumptions given, Emily can only infer Mila's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Emily and Mila were both in the back_yard together, but there is no information about any private or public interactions between them regarding the persimmon. Therefore, we cannot determine where Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is. The answer is not given in the story and cannot be inferred based on the given assumptions. The correct answer is "Cannot be determined."
