1. Emily, Mila, Benjamin, Emma and Charlotte entered the back_yard.
2. Benjamin lost his phone.
3. The persimmon is in the green_bathtub.
4. Mila likes the red_envelope.
5. Emily moved the persimmon to the red_envelope.
6. Emily exited the back_yard.
7. Mila moved the persimmon to the green_box.
8. Emma lost his phone.
9. Mila exited the back_yard.

Based on the assumptions, Mila could have inferred that Emily moved the persimmon to the red_envelope. However, Mila moved the persimmon to the green_box, which means she did not trust Emily's claim. Therefore, Mila thinks that the persimmon is not in the red_envelope, but rather in the green_box. 

The answer is B. green_bucket. 

Note: None of the options given in the question match the correct answer, so it is important to carefully analyze the story and make an inference based on the given assumptions.
