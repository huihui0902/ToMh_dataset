First, we need to determine where the persimmon actually is. According to the story, the persimmon was moved several times and ended up in the green bathtub. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the persimmon is. Charlotte privately told Emily that the persimmon is in the green bathtub, so we know that Charlotte knows where it is. However, we don't know if Emily or Mila know where it is.

Now we need to determine who Charlotte thinks Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is. Since Charlotte privately told Emily where the persimmon is, we can assume that Charlotte thinks Emily knows where it is. However, we don't know if Emily thinks Mila knows where it is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Charlotte thinks Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
