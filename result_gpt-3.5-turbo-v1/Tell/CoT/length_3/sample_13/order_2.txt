First, we need to determine where the onion actually is. According to the story, the onion is in the green_crate (as stated in steps 4, 11, and 35). 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the onion is. Lily publicly claimed that the onion is in the blue_bucket (step 16), but we know that this is a lie. Mila privately told Jack that the onion is in the blue_bucket (step 17), but we also know that this is a lie. Emily privately told Jack that the onion is in the green_crate (step 39), which is the true location of the onion. 

Now, we need to determine where Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is. We know that Abigail and Mila were both in the master_bedroom together (step 2), but we don't have any information about them having private or public interactions about the onion. However, we do know that Abigail moved the onion to the red_bucket (step 29), which is not the true location of the onion. 

Based on assumption (4), we know that Abigail tends to trust agents who exited the room later than herself. We don't have any information about the exit order of Mila and Abigail from the master_bedroom, so we can't use this assumption to determine where Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
