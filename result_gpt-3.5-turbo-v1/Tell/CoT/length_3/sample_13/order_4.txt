First, we need to determine where Emily thinks the onion is. According to step 35, Emily moved the onion to the green_crate. 

Next, we need to determine who Jack trusts the most. According to assumption (4), Jack would trust Mila the most since she exited the master_bedroom last. 

Now, we need to determine where Mila thinks the onion is. According to step 16, Lily publicly claimed that the onion is in the blue_bucket. However, according to step 38, Lily privately told Mila that the onion is in the green_crate. Since private communication takes precedence over public claims according to assumption (5), we can assume that Mila thinks the onion is in the green_crate. 

Finally, we need to determine where Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is. According to step 29, Abigail moved the onion to the red_bucket. However, since every agent tends to lie according to assumption (3), we cannot trust this information. Therefore, we need to look for any private or public interactions between Mila and Abigail. According to the story, Mila and Abigail entered the porch together but did not have any private or public interactions. Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is. 

In conclusion, we cannot determine where Emily thinks Jack thinks Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is. The answer is not provided in the story.
