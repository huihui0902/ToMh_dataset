First, we need to determine where the spinach actually is. According to the story, the spinach is in the red_drawer (assumption 1). 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the spinach is. Ella privately told Jackson that the spinach is in the red_crate (assumption 2). However, we know that Ella lied about the location of the spinach, so Jackson cannot trust her (assumption 3). 

Jack privately told Jacob that the spinach is in the red_drawer (assumption 2). Since the spinach is actually in the red_drawer, Jacob can trust Jack's information (assumption 3). 

Finally, we need to determine where Jack thinks Jackson thinks Jacob thinks the spinach is. Since Jack knows that Jacob knows the spinach is in the red_drawer, and Jackson trusts Jack more than Ella (assumption 4), Jack would likely assume that Jackson also thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer. Therefore, the answer is M. red_drawer.
