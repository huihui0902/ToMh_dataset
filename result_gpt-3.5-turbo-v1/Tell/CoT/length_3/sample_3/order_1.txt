First, we need to identify the agents who have interacted with the spinach. According to the story, Jackson, Jack, and Ella have all moved the spinach at some point. 

Next, we need to identify the agents who have interacted with Jacob. According to the story, Jackson, Jack, and Ella have all interacted with Jacob either privately or by being in the same place as him. 

Based on assumption (2), we know that Jacob can only infer the location of the spinach if he has interacted with an agent who knows its location. According to the story, Jack privately told Jacob that the spinach is in the red_drawer. 

Therefore, we can conclude that Jacob really thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer. The answer is M. red_drawer.
