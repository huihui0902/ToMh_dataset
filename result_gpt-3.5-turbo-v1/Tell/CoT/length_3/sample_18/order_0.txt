Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer that the cabbage is actually in the green_crate. This is because in step 14, William publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the green_envelope, but we know that every agent tends to lie. In step 15, Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket, but we cannot trust this information because Avery exited the office before Charlotte. In step 26, we know that the cabbage is in the green_bucket, but again, we cannot trust this information because Aiden made no movements and stayed in the office for 1 minute before exiting, so he could have lied. In step 38, William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate, and we can trust this information because William had no reason to lie to Carter privately. Therefore, the correct answer is G. green_crate.
