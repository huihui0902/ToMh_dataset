1. Avery entered the office with Aiden, Carter, William, and Charlotte.
2. Avery made no movements and stayed in the office for 1 minute.
3. Avery exited the office.
4. Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket.
5. Carter, Charlotte, and Avery entered the office.
6. Carter moved the spinach to the green_treasure_chest.
7. Charlotte moved the spinach to the green_bucket.
8. Avery made no movements and stayed in the office for 1 minute.
9. Avery moved the cabbage to the green_crate.
10. Avery exited the office.

Based on the given assumptions, Avery can infer Carter's thought only if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Avery was in the office with Carter and Charlotte, and Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket. Therefore, Avery knows where the cabbage is, but he doesn't know where Carter thinks the cabbage is.

So, the answer to the question is not given in the story and assumptions.
