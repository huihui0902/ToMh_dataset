1. Nathan moved the corn to the red_envelope.
2. Lily moved the corn to the green_envelope.
3. Amelia moved the corn to the green_drawer.
4. Alexander moved the corn to the green_box.
5. Abigail moved the corn to the green_bottle.

According to assumption (1), we know that every agent witnessed the movements of the corn before exiting the hallway. Therefore, all agents know the current location of the corn.

In the waiting room, Amelia publicly claimed that the corn is in the green_bottle, but Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope. According to assumption (2), Amelia can infer Abigail's thought because they had a private interaction. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust Amelia's public claim.

Therefore, based on the movements of the corn and the private interaction between Abigail and Amelia, we can conclude that the corn is actually in the green_envelope (option G).
