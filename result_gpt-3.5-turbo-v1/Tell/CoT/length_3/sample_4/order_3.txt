First, we need to determine where Lily thinks the corn is. According to the story, Lily moved the corn to the green_envelope before exiting the hallway. Therefore, Lily thinks the corn is in the green_envelope.

Next, we need to determine where Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is. According to the story, Nathan exited the hallway before any movements were made with the corn. Therefore, Nathan does not know where the corn is and cannot have a thought about where Amelia thinks the corn is.

Since Nathan has no thought about where Amelia thinks the corn is, Lily cannot have a thought about where Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is. Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
