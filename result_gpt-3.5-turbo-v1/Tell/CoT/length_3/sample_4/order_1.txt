1. Nathan, Lily, Amelia, Alexander and Abigail entered the hallway.
2. The corn is in the green_bottle.
3. Nathan moved the corn to the red_envelope.
4. Abigail saw a cat.
5. Nathan exited the hallway.
6. Lily moved the corn to the green_envelope.
7. Lily exited the hallway.
8. Amelia moved the corn to the green_drawer.
9. Amelia exited the hallway.
10. Alexander moved the corn to the green_box.
11. Alexander exited the hallway.
12. Abigail moved the corn to the green_bottle.
13. Abigail exited the hallway.
14. Nathan, Lily, Amelia, Alexander and Abigail entered the waiting_room.
15. Amelia publicly claimed that corn is in the green_bottle.
16. Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Amelia tends to lie and that private communication cannot be overheard. Therefore, we cannot trust Amelia's public claim that the corn is in the green bottle. However, we do know that Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green envelope. Since Amelia and Abigail were in the same place and had a private interaction, we can infer that Amelia really thinks the corn is in the green envelope. 

Therefore, the answer is G. green_envelope.
