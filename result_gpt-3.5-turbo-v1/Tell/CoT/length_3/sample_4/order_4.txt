First, we need to determine where the corn is currently located. According to Amelia's public claim in the waiting room, the corn is in the green bottle. Therefore, we can eliminate options C, E, K, L, M, and O.

Next, we need to determine who knows the true location of the corn. Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green envelope, so we know that Abigail knows the true location. However, we don't know if any of the other agents know the true location.

Now, we need to determine who Alexander thinks Lily thinks Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is. We know that Lily moved the corn to the green envelope before exiting the hallway, but we don't know if she knows the true location. Nathan moved the corn to the red envelope before exiting the hallway, so he may or may not know the true location. Amelia moved the corn to the green drawer before exiting the hallway, so she may or may not know the true location.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Alexander is more likely to trust an agent who exited the room later than himself. Lily exited the hallway before Nathan, Amelia, and Alexander, so Alexander may not trust her as much. Therefore, we can eliminate options G and J.

Based on assumption (3), we know that every agent tends to lie. Therefore, we cannot rely on any public claims made by the agents. We also cannot rely on any private communication that did not involve Alexander.

Based on the available information, the only option left is D. Amelia moved the corn to the green drawer before exiting the hallway, and Alexander may trust her more because she exited the hallway after him. Therefore, Alexander may think that Lily thinks Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the green cupboard.
