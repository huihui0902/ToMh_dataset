First, we need to determine where the corn actually is. According to the story, the corn was moved by each agent and ended up in the green bottle, which was where it originally was.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the corn is. Amelia publicly claimed that the corn is in the green bottle, so we know she knows where it is. Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green envelope, so she also knows where it is.

Nathan moved the corn to the red envelope, but he exited the hallway before Amelia publicly claimed where the corn was. Therefore, he does not know where Amelia thinks the corn is.

Based on assumption (4), Nathan may trust Abigail more since she exited the hallway after him. According to assumption (2), Nathan can infer Abigail's thought that the corn is in the green envelope. However, we are not asked where Abigail thinks the corn is, but where Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
