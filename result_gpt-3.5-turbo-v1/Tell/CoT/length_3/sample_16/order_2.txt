First, we know that Noah publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_envelope. However, we also know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot assume that this is his actual thought. 

Next, we need to determine if Aiden and Noah have been in the same place or have had any interactions that would allow Aiden to infer Noah's thoughts. From the story, we know that Aiden and Noah were both in the front_yard at the same time, but there is no mention of any interactions between them. 

We also know that Aiden moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard before exiting the front_yard, but we cannot assume that this is where he thinks the cherry is. 

Based on the given information, we cannot determine where Noah thinks Aiden thinks the cherry is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
