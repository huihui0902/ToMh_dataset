First, we need to determine where the cherry actually is. According to the story, Owen moved the cherry to the blue_bucket, but Noah publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_envelope. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust Noah's claim. Therefore, the cherry is actually in the blue_bucket.

Next, we need to determine where Aiden thinks the cherry is. Aiden moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard before exiting the front_yard. However, we don't know if Aiden saw Owen move the cherry to the blue_bucket, so we cannot be sure if Aiden's belief is accurate.

Now, we need to determine where Noah thinks the cherry is. Noah publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_envelope, but we know that he tends to lie. We also don't know if Noah saw Owen move the cherry to the blue_bucket. Therefore, we cannot be sure where Noah thinks the cherry is.

Finally, we need to determine where Owen thinks Noah thinks Aiden thinks the cherry is. Since we don't know where Noah thinks the cherry is, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Noah thinks Aiden thinks the cherry is. Therefore, the answer to the question is unknown.
