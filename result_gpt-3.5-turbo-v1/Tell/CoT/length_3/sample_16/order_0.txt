First, we know that Noah publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_envelope, but we also know that every agent tends to lie. Therefore, we cannot trust Noah's claim.

Next, we know that Ella privately told Noah that the cherry is in the blue_bottle. However, we cannot trust Ella's claim either because she may be lying.

We also know that Aiden moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard before exiting the front_yard. Therefore, the cherry could be in the blue_cupboard.

However, we cannot be sure because we do not know if Aiden is lying or not. Therefore, the answer to the question is J. blue_cupboard, but it is not a definitive answer.
