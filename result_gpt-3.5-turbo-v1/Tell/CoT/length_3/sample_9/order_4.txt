First, we need to determine where the watermelon actually is. According to the story, the watermelon ends up in the blue_container. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the watermelon is. Elizabeth moved the watermelon to the red_envelope, but Jacob moved it back to the blue_container. Carter publicly claimed that the watermelon is in the red_envelope, but Isla privately told him that it's in the blue_container. Nathan made no movements in the kitchen and exited before any of the watermelon movements occurred. 

Based on the assumptions given, Nathan cannot infer where the watermelon is based on the public claims or private communication. However, he can infer that Carter trusts Isla's information since he moved the banana to the blue_bucket based on her private communication. 

Therefore, Nathan may think that Elizabeth thinks Carter thinks Isla thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container. So the answer is I. blue_container.
