First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to the story, the melon was moved by Ella to the blue_bottle, then by Owen to the green_envelope, and finally by Aiden to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, the melon is in the blue_suitcase.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the melon is. Isla privately told Ella that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest, but this is a lie. Owen privately told Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase, which is true. Therefore, Aiden knows where the melon is.

Finally, we need to determine where Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. According to the story, Owen dislikes the pear and exited the back_yard before Aiden. Therefore, he trusts Aiden more than himself. Aiden privately told Evelyn that the banana is in the green_cupboard, which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, we can eliminate all answer choices that involve the banana.

Based on the information given, Owen thinks that Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue_suitcase, which is answer choice D.
