First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to the story, the melon was moved by Ella to the blue_bottle, then by Owen to the green_envelope, and finally by Aiden to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, the melon is in the blue_suitcase.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the melon is. Isla privately told Ella that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest, but we know that this is not true. Owen privately told Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase, which is true. Aiden privately told Evelyn that the banana is in the green_cupboard, which is also true.

Now, we need to determine where Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. Since Ella moved the melon to the blue_bottle before Owen and Aiden moved it to the blue_suitcase, Ella may think that the melon is still in the blue_bottle. However, we need to consider the assumption that agents tend to lie. Owen may have lied to Aiden about the location of the melon, so Ella cannot be sure where Owen thinks the melon is. Therefore, we cannot determine the answer to the question.
