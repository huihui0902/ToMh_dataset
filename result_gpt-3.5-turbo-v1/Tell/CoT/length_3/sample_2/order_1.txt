1. The melon was initially in the blue_treasure_chest, but Ella moved it to the blue_bottle and then exited the back_yard.
2. Owen moved the melon to the green_envelope and then exited the back-yard. 
3. Isla made no movements and stayed in the back-yard for 1 minute before exiting.
4. Aiden moved the melon to the blue_suitcase before exiting the back-yard.
5. Owen privately told Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase before they all entered the waiting_room.
6. Aiden privately told Evelyn that the banana is in the green_cupboard after they all entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, Aiden can only infer Owen's thought about the melon's location since Owen privately told him. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what Owen told Aiden. Therefore, we cannot determine where Aiden really thinks the melon is. The answer is unknown.
