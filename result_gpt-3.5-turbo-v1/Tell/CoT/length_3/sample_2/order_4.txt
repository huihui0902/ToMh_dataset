First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to the story, the melon was moved by Ella to the blue_bottle, then by Owen to the green_envelope, and finally by Aiden to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, the melon is in the blue_suitcase.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the melon is. According to the assumptions, Isla privately told Ella that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest, and Owen privately told Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase. Therefore, only Ella, Isla, Owen, and Aiden know where the melon is.

Now, we need to determine who Evelyn thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. Since Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute, she did not witness any of the movements of the melon. However, Aiden privately told Evelyn that the banana is in the green_cupboard. Therefore, Evelyn knows where the banana is, but not the melon.

Since we don't have any information about who exited the back_yard last, we cannot use assumption (4) to determine who Evelyn trusts. Therefore, we cannot determine where Evelyn thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. The answer is unknown.
