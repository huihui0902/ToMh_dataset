First, we need to determine where the turnip actually is. According to the story, Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard, but Avery publicly claimed that the turnip is in the blue_pantry. Since we know that every agent tends to lie, we cannot trust Avery's claim. Therefore, the turnip is actually in the blue_cupboard.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the turnip is. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope, but we don't know if Carter believes her or not. Mila and Owen made no movements and stayed in the sunroom, so they don't know where the turnip is. Avery moved the turnip to the red_envelope, but we don't know if she knows where it is now. Isla made no movements and stayed in the back_yard, so she doesn't know where the turnip is either.

Since Isla made no movements and stayed in the back_yard, she cannot know where Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is. Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
