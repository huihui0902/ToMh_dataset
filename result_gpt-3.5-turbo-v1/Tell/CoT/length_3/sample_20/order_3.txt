First, we need to determine where the turnip actually is. According to the story, Owen moved the turnip to the red_envelope. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the turnip is. Avery publicly claimed that the turnip is in the blue_pantry, which we know is a lie. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope, so we know that Carter knows where the turnip is.

Now we need to determine who Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is. Mila made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, she did not witness Owen moving the turnip to the red_envelope. 

Since Mila did not witness Owen moving the turnip, she cannot have a thought about where he thinks the turnip is. Therefore, Carter cannot have a thought about where Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is. The answer is none of the above (N/A).
