1. Mila and Owen were both in the sunroom, but Mila left before Owen moved the turnip.
2. Avery moved the turnip to the red_envelope after Owen moved it to the blue_cupboard.
3. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope.
4. Mila did not have any private or public interactions with Owen after he moved the turnip.

Based on these assumptions, Mila would not have any information about where Owen thinks the turnip is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the story and the correct answer is not listed among the options.
