1. Carter and Mila entered the sunroom, but made no movements and exited after 1 minute each. We don't have any information about the turnip yet.
2. The turnip is in the green_pantry. This information is given, so we can eliminate all other options except for F.
3. Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard. This means the turnip is no longer in the green_pantry, so we can eliminate F and J.
4. Avery moved the turnip to the red_envelope. This means the turnip is no longer in the blue_cupboard, so we can eliminate J and H.
5. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope. This confirms that the turnip is in the red_envelope, so the answer is I.
