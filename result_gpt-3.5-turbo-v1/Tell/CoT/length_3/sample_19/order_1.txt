1. Avery, Ava, William, Logan, and Amelia entered the cellar.
2. The cherry is in the blue_container.
3. Avery made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
4. Avery exited the cellar.
5. Ava made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
6. Ava exited the cellar.
7. William made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
8. Ava dislikes the beans.
9. William exited the cellar.

Based on the story and assumption (4), we know that William can trust Logan's claim about the cherry's location since Logan exited the cellar after William. Therefore, William should believe that the cherry is in the green_pantry, as that is what Logan privately told Amelia. 

Therefore, the answer is K. green_pantry.
