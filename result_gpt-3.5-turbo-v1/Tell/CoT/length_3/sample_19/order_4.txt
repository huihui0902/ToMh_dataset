1. The cherry was initially in the blue_container (statement 2).
2. Logan moved the cherry to the green_bucket (statement 10).
3. William likes the green_bucket (statement 12).
4. The cherry was moved to the green_pantry (statement 20).
5. Logan privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container (statement 39).

Based on these statements, we can conclude that Logan knows the cherry is in the blue_container, and Amelia knows this as well. However, we don't have any information about what Ava or William think about the location of the cherry.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
