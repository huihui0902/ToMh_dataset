1. The cherry is initially in the blue_container.
2. Avery, Ava, William, Logan, and Amelia all enter the cellar.
3. Avery and Ava both stay in the cellar for one minute without making any movements before exiting.
4. William also stays in the cellar for one minute without making any movements before exiting.
5. Logan moves the cherry from the blue_container to the green_bucket before exiting.
6. Amelia stays in the cellar for one minute without making any movements before exiting.
7. William publicly claims that the cherry is in the blue_container, but Amelia privately tells him that it is actually in the green_pantry.
8. Logan, Amelia, and William all enter the cellar again and move the cherry to the green_pantry before exiting.
9. Amelia then moves the cherry to the green_basket before exiting.
10. Ava moves the cherry back to the green_bucket before exiting.
11. Finally, Amelia moves the cherry to the blue_container before exiting.

Based on these events, we can determine that Ava was not present when William publicly claimed that the cherry was in the blue_container. Therefore, she would not have any reason to believe that William thinks the cherry is in the blue_container. Additionally, there is no indication that Ava had any private interactions with William or that she would trust him more than any other agent. Therefore, we cannot determine where Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
