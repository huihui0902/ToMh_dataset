First, we need to determine where the cherry actually is. According to the story, the cherry ends up in the green_basket (step 22). 

Next, we need to figure out who knows where the cherry is. Amelia privately tells William that the cherry is in the green_pantry (step 17), and Logan privately tells Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container (step 39). 

Now, we need to determine where Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. We know that William publicly claims that the cherry is in the blue_container (step 16), but we also know that William likes the green_bucket (step 12). Since Ava dislikes the beans (step 8) and moves the cherry to the green_bucket (step 33), it's possible that she thinks William also likes the green_bucket and therefore thinks the cherry is there. 

Therefore, the answer is O. green_bucket.
