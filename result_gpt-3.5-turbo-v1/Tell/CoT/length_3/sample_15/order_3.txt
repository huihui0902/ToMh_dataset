1. Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry, so he knows the actual location of the peach.
2. Aiden privately told Sophia that the peach is in the red_envelope, which means he lied to her about the location of the peach.
3. Benjamin privately told Abigail that the peach is in the red_pantry, which means Abigail knows the actual location of the peach.
4. Abigail moved the peach to the red_pantry, so she also knows the actual location of the peach.
5. Isla moved the peach to the red_bucket, but Aiden was not present in the hallway at that time, so he doesn't know about this movement.
6. Isla publicly claimed that the plum is in the red_bucket, but this claim doesn't affect Aiden's knowledge about the location of the peach.
7. Benjamin privately told Sophia that the plum is in the green_cupboard, but this also doesn't affect Aiden's knowledge about the location of the peach.
8. Aiden likes the red_crate, but there is no information about the peach being in the red_crate.
9. Aiden didn't have any private or public interaction with Abigail or Sophia regarding the location of the peach.
10. Aiden exited the hallway before Abigail moved the plum to the green_cupboard, so he doesn't know about this movement.
11. Based on the given assumptions, Aiden tends to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. Since he exited the hallway before Abigail, he may not trust her completely.
12. Therefore, Aiden may not think that Sophia thinks Abigail knows the actual location of the peach.
13. The answer is none of the above options.
