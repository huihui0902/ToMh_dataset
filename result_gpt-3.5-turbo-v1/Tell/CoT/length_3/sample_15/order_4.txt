1. Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry and privately told Sophia that the peach is in the red_envelope. Isla did not witness this interaction, so she does not know that Aiden told Sophia about the peach's location.
2. Isla moved the plum to the red_pantry and publicly claimed that the plum is in the red_bucket. This claim does not provide any information about the peach's location.
3. Abigail moved the plum to the green_cupboard and publicly claimed it. This also does not provide any information about the peach's location.
4. Isla thinks that Aiden thinks Sophia thinks Abigail thinks the peach is in the red_envelope, based on Aiden's private communication with Sophia. However, this is not necessarily the actual location of the peach, as the characters tend to lie. Therefore, the answer is K. red_envelope.
