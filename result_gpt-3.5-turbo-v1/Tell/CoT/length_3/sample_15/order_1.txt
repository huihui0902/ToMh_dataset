1. Abigail entered the hallway with Aiden, Benjamin, Sophia, and Isla.
2. Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry and then exited the hallway.
3. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute before exiting.
4. Isla moved the peach to the red_bucket before exiting the hallway.
5. Abigail, Aiden, Benjamin, Sophia, and Isla entered the waiting_room.
6. Benjamin privately told Abigail that the peach is in the red_pantry.
7. Abigail moved the peach to the red_pantry before exiting the hallway.
8. Abigail saw a monkey before Aiden exited the hallway.
9. Abigail moved the plum to the green_cupboard before exiting the hallway.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that Abigail can only infer the peach's location from her own observations or private interactions with other agents. We also know that Abigail tends to lie, so what she tells others doesn't necessarily reflect her actual thoughts.

From the story, we can see that Abigail was in the hallway when Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry and Isla moved it to the red_bucket. However, she made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute before exiting. This suggests that she didn't see where the peach was moved to.

Later on, Benjamin privately told Abigail that the peach is in the red_pantry. Abigail then moved the peach to the red_pantry before exiting the hallway. This suggests that she believed Benjamin's claim and thought that the peach was in the red_pantry.

Therefore, the answer is N. red_pantry.
