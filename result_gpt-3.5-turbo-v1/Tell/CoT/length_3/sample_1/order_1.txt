1. The story mentions that Jack likes the blue_crate, but it doesn't give any indication that he thinks the peas is there.
2. There is no mention of the peas being in the green_drawer, red_basket, blue_drawer, green_bathtub, green_pantry, red_envelope, red_bucket, or red_pantry.
3. Emily publicly claims that the peas is in the blue_suitcase, but we know that characters tend to lie, so we cannot trust this claim.
4. Isabella privately tells Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle, but Jack was not present for this conversation, so he cannot know this information.
5. Isabella privately tells Emily that the cherry is in the blue_cupboard, but this doesn't give any indication of where the peas is.
6. Logan privately tells Jackson that the cherry is in the blue_cupboard, but this also doesn't give any indication of where the peas is.
7. The only remaining options are green_envelope, blue_crate, and green_bottle. Isabella moved the cherry to the green_envelope, but there is no indication that she moved the peas there. Logan moved the potato to the blue_crate, but there is no indication that he moved the peas there. Emily moved the peas to the green_bottle, but we cannot trust her claim that she dislikes peas.

Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine where Jack really thinks the peas is. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
