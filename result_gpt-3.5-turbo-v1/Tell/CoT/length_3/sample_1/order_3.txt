First, we need to determine where the peas actually are. According to the story, Emily publicly claimed that the peas are in the blue suitcase, but Isabella privately told Logan that the peas are in the green bottle. Since Isabella's statement is private and cannot be overheard, we can assume that Logan knows the true location of the peas is in the green bottle.

Next, we need to determine where Jack likes and moves the peas. According to the story, Jack likes the blue crate, and he moves the peas to the red crate. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, L, and K.

Now, we need to determine where Emily moves the peas. According to the story, Emily moves the peas to the green bottle. Therefore, we can eliminate options F, O, and M.

Next, we need to determine where Isabella moves the potato and the cherry. According to the story, Isabella moves the potato to the red basket and the cherry to the green envelope. Therefore, we can eliminate options B, E, J, and N.

Now, we need to determine where Logan moves the potato and the cherry. According to the story, Logan moves the potato to the blue crate and the cherry to the blue cupboard. Therefore, we can eliminate options C, D, G, and H.

Finally, we need to determine where Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas are. Since we know that Jack moves the peas to the red crate, and Logan moves the cherry to the blue cupboard, we can assume that Jackson trusts Logan's statement and knows that the cherry is in the blue cupboard. Therefore, Jackson thinks that Jack thinks the peas are in the blue drawer, which is the only option left.

Therefore, the answer is D. blue_drawer.
