1. Logan, Jackson, Jack, Emily, and Isabella entered the hallway.
2. The peas is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Logan made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute.
4. Logan exited the hallway.
5. Jackson made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute.
6. Jack likes the blue_crate.
7. Jackson exited the hallway.

Based on the story and assumption (1), we know that Jackson witnessed everything that happened in the hallway before he exited. We also know that Jack likes the blue_crate, but we don't have any information about where he thinks the peas is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas is. The answer is not provided in the story. The correct answer is not listed among the options.
