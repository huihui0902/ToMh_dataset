First, we need to determine where the peas actually is. According to the story, Emily publicly claimed that the peas is in the blue_suitcase, but we know that every agent tends to lie. Therefore, we cannot be sure if this claim is true or not.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the peas is. Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle, but we don't know if Logan trusts Isabella or not. Jack moved the peas to the red_crate, but we don't know if anyone else knows this.

Now, we need to determine who Isabella thinks Logan thinks Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas is. Since Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle, we can assume that Isabella thinks Logan knows this. However, we don't know if Logan trusts Isabella or not.

We also don't know if Jackson or Jack know where the peas is, so we cannot determine what Isabella thinks they think.

Therefore, we cannot answer the question with the given information. The answer is not provided in the options.
