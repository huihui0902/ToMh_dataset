First, we need to determine where the spinach actually is. According to the story, Avery privately told Noah that the spinach is in the green_pantry, and Isabella publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_pantry. Therefore, we can conclude that the spinach is in the green_pantry.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the spinach is. According to the story, Hannah privately told Isabella that the spinach is in the green_cupboard, but this information is incorrect. Avery is the only one who knows where the spinach actually is, as he privately told Noah that it is in the green_pantry.

Now, we need to determine who Nathan thinks knows where the spinach is. Nathan witnessed Avery moving the spinach to the green_pantry, so he knows where it is. However, he also knows that Avery tends to lie, so he may not fully trust Avery's information. Nathan also knows that Isabella publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_pantry, but he may not trust her either since she tends to lie.

The only other person who Nathan has interacted with and who knows where the spinach is, is Hannah. However, Hannah lost his gloves and did not exit the waiting room with the others, so Nathan may not trust his information either.

Therefore, it is difficult to determine where Nathan thinks Isabella thinks Hannah thinks Avery thinks the spinach is. It is possible that Nathan does not trust anyone's information and has formed his own conclusion based on his own observations. Without more information, we cannot determine a specific answer to the question.
