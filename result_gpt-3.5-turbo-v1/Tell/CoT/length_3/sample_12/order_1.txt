Based on the assumptions given, we know that Avery can only infer Noah's thought about the spinach if they had a private interaction. From assumption (2), we know that Avery and Hannah had a private interaction, but there is no information about Noah and Avery having a private interaction. Therefore, we cannot determine where Avery really thinks the spinach is. The answer is unknown.
