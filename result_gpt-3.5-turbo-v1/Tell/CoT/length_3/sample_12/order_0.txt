Isabella made no movements and stayed in the dining room for 1 minute before exiting. Avery moved the spinach to the red crate before exiting. Hannah moved the spinach to the green cupboard before exiting. Noah made no movements and stayed in the dining room for 1 minute before exiting. Nathan moved the spinach to the green pantry before exiting.

We also know that the agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust what they say to others. However, we can infer their thoughts based on their private or public interactions.

From the story, we know that Hannah privately told Isabella that the spinach is in the green cupboard, and Avery privately told Noah that the spinach is in the green pantry. We also know that Isabella publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green pantry, and Avery privately told Hannah that the cherry is in the green box.

Since we cannot trust what the agents say, we need to rely on their actions and interactions to infer the location of the spinach. Based on the movements of the agents and their private interactions, we can infer that the spinach is in the green pantry. Therefore, the answer is L. green pantry.
