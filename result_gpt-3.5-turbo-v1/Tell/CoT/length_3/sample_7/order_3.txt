First, we need to determine where the lime actually is. According to the story, Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green bottle, and Sophia privately told Benjamin that the lime is in the green bottle. Therefore, we can conclude that the lime is in the green bottle.

Next, we need to determine where Chloe thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is. Since Chloe and Sophia were both in the laundry together, they could have had a private interaction. However, we don't have any information about what they discussed during that interaction. We do know that Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green bottle, so Chloe would be aware of that. However, we don't have any information about what Chloe thinks about the location of the lime.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Chloe thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
