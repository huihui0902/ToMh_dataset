First, we need to identify where the lime is actually located. According to the story, the lime was moved to the green treasure chest by Benjamin, and then moved back to the green bottle by Sophia. Therefore, the lime is in the green bottle.

Next, we need to identify who knows where the lime is. According to the story, Sophia privately told Benjamin that the lime is in the green bottle, and Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green bottle. Therefore, Sophia, Benjamin, and Amelia all know where the lime is.

Finally, we need to identify where Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is. According to the story, Sophia and Amelia were both in the waiting room when Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green bottle. Therefore, Sophia knows that Amelia knows that the lime is in the green bottle. Since we know that every agent tends to lie, we cannot assume that Amelia's public claim is her actual thought. Therefore, we cannot determine where Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
