1. Benjamin moved the lime to the green_treasure_chest, but he exited the porch before anyone else. So, no one else witnessed this movement.
2. Isabella moved the lime to the blue_crate, but she also exited the porch before anyone else. So, no one else witnessed this movement.
3. Chloe moved the lime to the green_envelope, but she also exited the porch before anyone else. So, no one else witnessed this movement.
4. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute. She didn't witness any movement of the lime.
5. Sophia moved the lime to the green_bottle, but she did it after Chloe exited the porch. So, according to assumption (4), Chloe would trust Sophia's claim more than anyone else's.

Therefore, the lime is really in the green_bottle. The answer is A.
