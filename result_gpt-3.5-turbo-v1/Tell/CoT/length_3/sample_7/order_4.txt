First, we need to determine where Isabella thinks the lime is. We know that Isabella moved the lime to the blue_crate before exiting the porch. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust this information.

Next, we need to determine where Chloe thinks the lime is. We do not have any information about Chloe's thoughts on the lime.

Then, we need to determine where Sophia thinks the lime is. We know that Sophia privately told Benjamin that the lime is in the green_bottle. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust this information.

Finally, we need to determine where Amelia thinks the lime is. We know that Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle when she entered the waiting_room with Isabella, Sophia, and Amelia. However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust this information.

Based on the given assumptions, we can only infer what Isabella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is. We do not have enough information to determine the actual location of the lime.

Therefore, the answer to the question is not provided in the given story and assumptions.
