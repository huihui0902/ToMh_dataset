1. Benjamin moved the lime to the green_treasure_chest, but he exited the porch before any private or public interaction.
2. Isabella moved the lime to the blue_crate, but she also exited the porch before any private or public interaction.
3. Chloe moved the lime to the green_envelope, but she also exited the porch before any private or public interaction.
4. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute, so she witnessed all the previous movements.
5. Sophia moved the lime back to the green_bottle, but she did it after Amelia exited the porch, so Amelia cannot know about this movement.
6. Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle, but we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust her claim.
7. Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia really thinks the lime is based on the given information.
