1. The turnip is initially in the green_crate (statement 2).
2. Liam moves the turnip to the blue_pantry (statement 5), but this doesn't affect the actual location of the turnip.
3. William moves the turnip to the red_bottle (statement 7), but this doesn't affect the actual location of the turnip either.
4. Private communication between William and Sophia reveals that the turnip is in the red_bottle (statement 16).
5. Sophia moves the turnip to the green_basket (statement 20), but Benjamin moves it back to the green_crate (statement 22).
6. Therefore, the turnip is actually in the green_crate (option B).
