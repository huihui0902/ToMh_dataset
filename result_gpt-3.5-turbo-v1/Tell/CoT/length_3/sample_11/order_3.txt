First, we need to determine where the spinach actually is. According to statement 2, the spinach is in the green_pantry. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the spinach is. Isla moved the spinach to the green_pantry, but only Jack knows where it actually is because Isla privately told him that it's in the blue_suitcase. 

Now we need to determine who Jack thinks Benjamin thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is. According to statement 15, Jack publicly claimed that the spinach is in the green_pantry. However, we know that Jack tends to lie, so we can't trust his public claim. 

We also know that Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute, so he didn't witness where the spinach actually is. 

Abigail dislikes the spinach, so it's unlikely that she would have any thoughts about where it is. 

Therefore, we can conclude that Jack doesn't think Benjamin thinks Abigail thinks anything about the spinach's location. The answer is not provided in the options given.
