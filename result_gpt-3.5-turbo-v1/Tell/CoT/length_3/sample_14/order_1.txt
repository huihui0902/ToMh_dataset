1. Nathan, Emma, Avery, Isabella and Abigail entered the front_yard.
2. Abigail saw a mouse.
3. The carrot is in the red_envelope.
4. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.
5. Nathan exited the front_yard.
6. Avery saw a dog.
7. Emma made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.
8. Emma exited the front_yard.
9. Avery made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.
10. Avery exited the front_yard.
11. Isabella moved the carrot to the red_container.
12. Isabella exited the front_yard.
13. Abigail moved the carrot to the red_envelope.
14. Abigail exited the front_yard.

Based on assumption (2), Abigail's actual thought about the location of the carrot cannot be inferred from her actions or statements in this scenario. However, based on assumption (3), we know that Abigail tends to lie, so her statement to Nathan in step 17 that the carrot is in the red_envelope may not be true. 

In step 29, it is stated that the carrot is in the red_envelope, but we cannot assume that Abigail's statement to Nathan in step 17 is true. Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail really thinks the carrot is located. 

The correct answer is: Cannot be determined.
