First, we need to determine where the carrot actually is. According to the story, the carrot was moved by Avery to the red_bucket, then by Jack to the blue_crate, and finally by Chloe to the green_box. Therefore, the carrot is in the green_box.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the carrot is. Sophia privately told Jack that the carrot is in the green_box, so Sophia knows where the carrot is. However, we need to determine where Sophia thinks Avery thinks Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is.

We know that Avery dislikes the cherry and likes the red_pantry. However, we don't have any information about what Avery thinks about the carrot's location. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute, so she didn't witness the movements of the carrot. Chloe made the final movement of the carrot to the green_box, so she knows where the carrot is. Therefore, Sophia might think that Chloe knows where the carrot is.

However, we don't have any information about what Amelia thinks about the carrot's location. Therefore, we cannot determine where Sophia thinks Avery thinks Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
