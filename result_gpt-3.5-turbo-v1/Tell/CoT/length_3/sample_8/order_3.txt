First, we need to determine where the carrot actually is. According to the story, the carrot was moved by multiple agents and ended up in the red_pantry, as stated by Sophia. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the carrot is. Sophia privately told Jack that the carrot is in the green_box, but we know that Sophia tends to lie. Jack publicly claimed that the carrot is in the green_treasure_chest, but we also know that every agent tends to lie. Therefore, we cannot trust either of their statements.

Now, we need to determine where Avery thinks Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is. We know that Avery dislikes the cherry and likes the red_pantry. Amelia lost his phone and made no movements in the garage or closet. Chloe moved the carrot to the green_box and made no movements in the closet. 

Since Avery and Chloe were both in the closet together, Avery can infer Chloe's thought about the carrot's location. However, we do not know if Amelia was in the same place as Chloe and Avery at any point, or if they had any private or public interactions. Therefore, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
