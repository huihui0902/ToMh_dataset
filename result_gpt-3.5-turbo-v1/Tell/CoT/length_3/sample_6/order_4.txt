1. Hannah saw a monkey, which is not related to the location of the orange.
2. Jacob moved the orange to the blue_bottle, so he knows the orange is not in the green_box.
3. Jackson saw a dog, which is not related to the location of the orange.
4. Isabella publicly claimed that the orange is in the blue_bucket, but we know from assumption (3) that what she says may not be true.
5. Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container, so Hannah knows the orange is not in the blue_bucket.
6. Isabella moved the orange to the blue_bucket, so she knows the orange is not in the red_container.
7. Hannah privately told Isabella that the orange is in the blue_bottle, so she knows the orange is not in the red_container or the blue_bucket.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that Hannah thinks Jacob thinks Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is in the blue_bottle (option D).
