1. The orange was initially in the green_box, but it was moved to the blue_bottle by Jacob, and then to the red_container by Jackson.
2. Isabella publicly claimed that the orange is in the blue_bucket, but we know that she tends to lie.
3. Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container, but we don't know if Isabella is aware of this information.
4. Isabella moved the orange to the blue_bucket, but we don't know if she did this based on her own belief or if she was trying to deceive others.
5. Hannah privately told Isabella that the orange is in the blue_bottle, but we don't know if Isabella trusts Hannah or if she thinks Hannah is lying.

Based on these facts and assumptions, we can make some inferences. Since Isabella made no movements in the laundry and lounge, we know that she did not witness the movements of the orange. Therefore, her belief about the location of the orange is based on what she has been told or what she has inferred from others' claims.

We also know that Isabella tends to lie, so her public claim that the orange is in the blue_bucket may not be true. However, we don't have any evidence to suggest that she knows where the orange actually is.

Since Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container, and Isabella was not present for this conversation, we can assume that Isabella does not know this information. Therefore, we cannot say for sure where Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is.

Based on the available information, the answer to the question is: Insufficient information to determine.
