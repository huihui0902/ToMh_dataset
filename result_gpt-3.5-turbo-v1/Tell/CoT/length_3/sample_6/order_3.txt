First, we need to determine where the orange actually is. According to statement 29, the orange is in the red_container.

Next, we need to figure out who knows where the orange is. Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container (statement 17), and Jackson publicly claimed that the orange is in the red_container (statement 41).

Now we need to determine where Jacob thinks Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is. According to statement 34, Isabella moved the orange to the blue_bucket. However, we don't know if Jacob witnessed this movement or not.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that Jacob can only infer Owen's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that Jacob tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself.

From the story, we can see that Jacob exited the laundry before Isabella moved the orange to the blue_bucket (statement 38). Therefore, Jacob may not know that the orange was moved to the blue_bucket.

Since we don't have any information about Isabella's thoughts on the location of the orange, we cannot determine where Jacob thinks Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is.

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information.
