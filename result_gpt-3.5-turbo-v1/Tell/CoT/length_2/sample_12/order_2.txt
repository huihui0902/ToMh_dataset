Based on the assumptions given, we know that Jackson can only infer Avery's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what Avery tells others doesn't necessarily reflect his actual thought. Finally, we know that an agent tends to trust another agent that exited the room later than himself.

From the story, we know that Jackson and Avery were in the pantry together, so Jackson can infer Avery's thought about the spinach. However, we don't have any information about what Avery said or did in the pantry, so we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is.

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information.
