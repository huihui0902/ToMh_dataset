First, we need to determine where the spinach actually is. According to the story, the spinach was initially in the green_envelope, but Mila moved it to the blue_container, and then Jackson moved it back to the green_envelope. So, the spinach is in the green_envelope.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the spinach is. Mila, Jackson, and possibly Avery know where the spinach is, but Isabella and Nathan do not.

Now, we need to determine who Isabella thinks Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is. Since Isabella does not know where the spinach is, she cannot make an accurate guess about where Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the story and cannot be determined.
