Based on the assumptions given, we know that Hannah can only infer Emma's thought if they have been in the same place or have had a private or public interaction. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thought.

From the story, we know that Hannah moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting the hallway. Emma was also in the hallway before exiting and privately told Logan that the peas is in the red_bottle. However, we don't know if Hannah and Emma had any interaction or were in the same place at any point.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
