First, we need to determine where the peas actually is. According to the story, the peas is in the red_bottle (as stated in lines 2 and 26).

Next, we need to determine who Chloe thinks has the peas. There is no direct information about Chloe's thoughts on this matter, but we do know that Chloe moved the peas to the red_bottle (line 12) and then lost his phone (line 14) before exiting the hallway. Therefore, Chloe may not have had any further interactions or information about the location of the peas.

Moving on to Hannah, we know that she moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest (line 9) and then exited the hallway (line 11). Therefore, she may not have had any further interactions or information about the location of the peas.

Next, we need to determine what Emma thinks about the location of the peas. We know that Emma stayed in the hallway for 1 minute (line 5), moved the peas to the red_pantry (line 22), and then exited the hallway (line 23). We also know that Emma privately told Logan that the peas is in the red_bottle (line 26). Therefore, Emma knows that the peas is in the red_bottle, but we don't have any information about what she thinks about Chloe or Hannah's thoughts on the matter.

Finally, we need to determine what Logan thinks about Chloe, Hannah, and Emma's thoughts on the location of the peas. We know that Logan stayed in the hallway for 1 minute (line 3), moved the peas to the blue_bathtub (line 20), and then exited the hallway (line 21). We also know that Logan publicly claimed that the peas is in the green_bottle (line 25), but Emma privately told him that the peas is actually in the red_bottle (line 26).

Based on the given assumptions, we can infer that Logan may trust Emma's information about the location of the peas since they had a private interaction. However, we don't have any information about what Logan thinks about Chloe or Hannah's thoughts on the matter.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Logan thinks Chloe thinks Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
