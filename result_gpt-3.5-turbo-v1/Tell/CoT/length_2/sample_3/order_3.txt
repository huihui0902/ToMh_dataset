First, we need to determine where Chloe thinks the peas is. Based on the story, Chloe moved the peas to the red_bottle before losing his phone and exiting the hallway. Therefore, Chloe thinks the peas is in the red_bottle.

Next, we need to determine where Hannah thinks the peas is. Based on the story, Hannah moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting the hallway. However, we don't know if Hannah knows where the peas is currently located.

Then, we need to determine where Emma thinks the peas is. Based on the story, Emma privately told Logan that the peas is in the red_bottle. Therefore, Emma thinks the peas is in the red_bottle.

Finally, we need to determine where Chloe thinks Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is. Since Chloe thinks the peas is in the red_bottle and Emma thinks the peas is in the red_bottle, Chloe would likely assume that Emma also thinks the peas is in the red_bottle. However, we don't have enough information to determine where Chloe thinks Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is.

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given options.
