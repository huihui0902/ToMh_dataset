1. Logan, William, Jacob, Sophia, and Isla entered the front yard.
2. The watermelon is in the red container.
3. Logan made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
4. Sophia lost his phone.
5. Logan exited the front yard.
6. Isla saw a dog.
7. William made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
8. William exited the front yard.
9. Jacob moved the watermelon to the red basket.
10. Jacob exited the front yard.
11. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
12. Sophia exited the front yard.
13. Isla moved the watermelon to the red container.

From the story, we know that Logan was in the front yard when the watermelon was in the red container. However, Logan made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute, so he did not witness Jacob moving the watermelon to the red basket. Therefore, Logan does not know that the watermelon was moved to the red basket.

Later, Logan, William, and Jacob entered the hall, and Logan publicly claimed that the eggplant is in the red box. However, we do not have any information about where Isla thinks the watermelon is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Logan thinks Isla thinks Jacob thinks the watermelon is. The answer is not provided in the story and assumptions given.
