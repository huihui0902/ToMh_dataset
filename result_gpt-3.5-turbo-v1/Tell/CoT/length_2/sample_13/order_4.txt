Based on the assumptions given, we know that Sophia can only infer what Logan thinks if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. Sophia was in the front yard with Logan, but there is no indication that they had any interactions. Therefore, we cannot determine where Sophia thinks Logan thinks Isla thinks the watermelon is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
