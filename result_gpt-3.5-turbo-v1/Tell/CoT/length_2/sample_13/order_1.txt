1. Logan, William, Jacob, Sophia, and Isla entered the front yard.
2. The watermelon is in the red container.
3. Logan made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
4. Sophia lost his phone.
5. Logan exited the front yard.
6. Isla saw a dog.
7. William made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
8. William exited the front yard.
9. Jacob moved the watermelon to the red basket.
10. Jacob exited the front yard.

Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Jacob's actual thought about the watermelon's location is not necessarily what he told others. We also know that he made a movement to move the watermelon to a different location before exiting the front yard. Therefore, we cannot trust his public claim or what he told Isla privately.

The only information we have is that the watermelon was initially in the red container and that Jacob moved it to a different location. The only option that matches this information is D. red_basket. Therefore, the answer is D. red_basket.
