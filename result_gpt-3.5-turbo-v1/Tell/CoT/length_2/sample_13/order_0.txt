Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Logan, William, Jacob, Sophia, and Isla were all in the front yard at some point. Jacob moved the watermelon to the red_basket, but we don't know if he told anyone about it. Sophia lost his phone and made no movements after entering the front yard. Logan made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute before exiting. Isla saw a dog and made no movements related to the watermelon.

Therefore, we cannot determine the true location of the watermelon based on the given information. None of the options provided match the red_basket where Jacob moved the watermelon. The answer is unknown.
