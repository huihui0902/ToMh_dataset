1. Hannah moved the asparagus to the green_treasure_chest, so Avery knows that the asparagus is not in the green_cupboard.
2. Owen likes the green_basket, but there is no information about him knowing where the asparagus is.
3. Emily likes the red_crate, but there is no information about her knowing where the asparagus is.
4. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the hall and bathroom for 1 minute each, so he didn't have the opportunity to move the asparagus.
5. Hannah publicly claimed that the carrot is in the blue_crate, but this doesn't give any information about the location of the asparagus.
6. Aiden privately told Emily that the carrot is in the green_basket, but this doesn't necessarily mean that he knows where the asparagus is.
7. Avery made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute, so she didn't have the opportunity to move the asparagus or overhear any private conversations about it.
8. Based on assumption (2), Avery can only infer Aiden's thought if they have been in the same place or had a private or public interaction. The only time they were in the same place was in the waiting_room, but there is no information about them having any interactions there.
9. Based on assumption (4), Avery may be more likely to trust Aiden's thoughts since he exited the bathroom after her, but this doesn't give any information about the location of the asparagus.

Therefore, there is not enough information to determine where Avery thinks Emily thinks Aiden thinks the asparagus is. The answer is none of the above (N/A).
