First, we need to determine where the asparagus is. According to statement 2, the asparagus is in the green_cupboard. 

Next, we need to determine where Hannah moved the asparagus to. According to statement 4, Hannah moved the asparagus to the green_treasure_chest. 

Now, we need to determine where Hannah, Avery, Emily, and Aiden were when they were in the same place. According to statement 15, they were all in the waiting_room together. 

We also need to determine who exited the waiting_room last. Since we know that agents tend to trust those who exit a room later than themselves, we need to determine the order of exits. According to statements 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14, Avery exited last. 

Now, we need to determine who had private interactions with whom. According to statement 27, Aiden privately told Emily that the carrot is in the green_basket. 

Finally, we need to determine where Hannah thinks Avery thinks Emily thinks Aiden thinks the asparagus is. Since we know that Hannah moved the asparagus to the green_treasure_chest, we can eliminate all options except for those that have "green" in them. 

Since we don't have any information about where Avery, Emily, or Aiden think the asparagus is, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Avery thinks Emily thinks Aiden thinks the asparagus is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information.
