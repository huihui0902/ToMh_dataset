1. Chloe moved the cherry to the green_pantry, so it is not in the red_drawer or blue_drawer.
2. Owen moved the cherry to the green_bucket, so it is not in the green_pantry or red_pantry.
3. We don't have any information about Emma, Ella, or Abigail's movements regarding the cherry, so we cannot eliminate any options based on their actions.
4. Therefore, the cherry could be in either the green_basket, blue_crate, red_crate, green_bathtub, green_crate, or green_bucket.
5. However, we know that Chloe privately told Owen that the apple is in the green_crate, which means that she may have lied to him. Therefore, we cannot trust this information completely.
6. Based on the given information, we cannot determine the exact location of the cherry. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
