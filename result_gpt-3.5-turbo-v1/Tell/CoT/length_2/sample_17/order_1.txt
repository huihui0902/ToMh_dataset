First, we know that Chloe moved the cherry from the red_drawer to the green_pantry, and then Owen moved it from the green_pantry to the green_bucket. We also know that Abigail, Emma, and Ella made no movements and stayed in the staircase for one minute before exiting. 

Next, we know that Chloe privately told Owen that the apple is in the green_crate. However, we don't know if Owen trusts Chloe or not. 

We also know that Owen lost his watch, but this doesn't give us any information about where he thinks the cherry is. 

Finally, we know that Ella publicly claimed that the apple is in the blue_container, but again, this doesn't give us any information about where Owen thinks the cherry is. 

Based on the information given, we can't definitively determine where Owen thinks the cherry is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
