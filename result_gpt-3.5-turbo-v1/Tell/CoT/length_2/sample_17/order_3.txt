First, we need to determine where the cherry is currently located. According to the story, Chloe initially moved the cherry from the red_drawer to the green_pantry, and then Owen moved it from the green_pantry to the green_bucket. Therefore, the cherry is currently in the green_bucket.

Next, we need to determine where the apple is currently located. According to the story, Ella initially moved the apple from the blue_drawer to the green_bathtub, and then Emma moved it from the green_bathtub to the red_crate, and finally Chloe moved it from the red_crate to the green_crate. Therefore, the apple is currently in the green_crate.

Now, we need to determine the interactions between Abigail, Ella, and Owen. According to the story, Abigail made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute before exiting. Ella publicly claimed that the apple is in the blue_container, which we know is false based on our previous analysis. Owen lost his watch, but we don't have any information about his thoughts or interactions with Abigail.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks the cherry is located, as there is no information provided about their interactions or thoughts regarding the cherry. The answer is none of the above.
