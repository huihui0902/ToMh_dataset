27. Isabella privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_crate.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Amelia can only infer Nathan's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't affect their actual thought.

From the story, we know that Nathan moved the pear to the blue_pantry, but we don't know if he told anyone about it. Amelia moved the cherry to the red_envelope and publicly claimed it, so we know that Nathan heard her claim. Isabella privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_crate, but we don't know if Nathan heard this conversation.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
