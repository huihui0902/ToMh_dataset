1. Isabella, Owen, Amelia, Aiden and Nathan entered the sunroom.
2. The pear is in the blue_pantry.
3. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
4. Isabella exited the sunroom.
5. Owen made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
6. Owen exited the sunroom.

Based on the assumptions, we know that Isabella and Owen did not move the pear since they made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for only 1 minute each. Therefore, the pear is still in the blue_pantry.

Answer: L. blue_pantry
