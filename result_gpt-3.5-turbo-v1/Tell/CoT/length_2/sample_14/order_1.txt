1. Isabella, Owen, Amelia, Aiden and Nathan entered the sunroom.
2. The pear is in the blue_pantry.
3. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
4. Isabella exited the sunroom.
5. Owen made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
6. Owen exited the sunroom.
7. Isabella saw a mouse.
8. Amelia moved the pear to the green_bucket.
9. Amelia exited the sunroom.
10. Aiden moved the pear to the blue_suitcase.
11. Isabella lost his gloves.
12. Aiden exited the sunroom.
13. Nathan moved the pear to the blue_pantry.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Nathan witnessed all the movements before he exited the sunroom. Therefore, he knows that the pear was moved from the blue_pantry to the green_bucket by Amelia, and then to the blue_suitcase by Aiden. Finally, Nathan moved the pear to the blue_pantry. 

Based on assumption (2), we know that Nathan can infer Isabella's thought because they were both in the sunroom before Isabella exited. However, we don't have any information about Isabella's thought on the location of the pear.

Based on assumption (3), we know that Nathan's public claim in the waiting_room that the cherry is in the red_container may not reflect his actual thought.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Nathan tends to trust Amelia more than Isabella because Amelia exited the sunroom after Nathan did.

Based on assumption (5), we know that Nathan's private communication with Amelia in the waiting_room that the cherry is in the blue_crate may reflect his actual thought.

Therefore, based on the given information and assumptions, Nathan really thinks the pear is in the blue_pantry. The answer is L. blue_pantry.
