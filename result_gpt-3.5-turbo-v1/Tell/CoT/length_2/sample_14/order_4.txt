1. Isabella and Owen entered the sunroom together.
2. The pear was in the blue_pantry when they entered.
3. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
4. Isabella exited the sunroom.
5. Owen made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
6. Owen exited the sunroom.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Owen can only infer Isabella's thoughts if they had a private or public interaction. However, there is no mention of any interaction between Isabella and Owen in the sunroom. Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Isabella thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
