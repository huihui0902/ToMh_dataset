First, we need to determine where the watermelon actually is. According to the story, Benjamin moved the watermelon from the blue_bottle to the green_drawer, and Isabella then moved it to the blue_bucket. Therefore, the watermelon is currently in the blue_bucket.

Next, we need to determine what Benjamin thinks about the watermelon's location. The story tells us that Benjamin likes the blue_bottle, but it doesn't give us any information about where he thinks the watermelon is.

Now, we need to consider Emma's perspective. The story tells us that Emma made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, she witnessed Benjamin moving the watermelon from the blue_bottle to the green_drawer, but she did not witness Isabella moving it to the blue_bucket.

Based on this information, we cannot determine where Emma thinks Benjamin thinks the watermelon is. The story does not give us any clues about Emma's thoughts on this matter. Therefore, the answer to the question is unknown.
