First, we need to find out who moved the watermelon to where. According to the story, Benjamin moved the watermelon to the green_drawer, and then Isabella moved it to the blue_bucket, and finally, Charlotte moved it to the blue_container. 

Next, we need to consider Benjamin's likes and dislikes. According to the story, Benjamin dislikes the lime and likes the blue_bottle. There is no mention of his preference for any other container or location.

Finally, we need to consider any private or public interactions that Benjamin had with other agents. According to the story, Isabella privately told Benjamin that the green_pepper is in the red_box. There is no mention of any private or public interactions related to the watermelon.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that Benjamin really thinks the watermelon is in the green_drawer, as that is where he moved it to and there is no evidence to suggest that he changed his mind or was told otherwise. Therefore, the answer is D. red_drawer.
