First, we need to identify which agents were in the workshop when the watermelon was moved. According to the story, Benjamin, Isabella, Emma, Charlotte, and Liam were all in the workshop at some point. 

Next, we need to track the movements of the watermelon. It was initially in the blue_bottle, then moved to the green_drawer by Benjamin, then to the blue_bucket by Isabella, and finally to the blue_container by Charlotte. 

We also know that Benjamin likes the blue_bottle and dislikes lime, while Charlotte likes the green_envelope and moved the green_pepper to the green_envelope in the lounge. Liam likes the blue_bucket and privately told Isabella that the green_pepper is in the red_bottle. Isabella then privately told Benjamin that the green_pepper is in the red_box. 

Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, B, D, J, K, L, M, N, and O as they have no connection to the watermelon. 

Option C (red_box) is where Isabella said the green_pepper is, but this doesn't necessarily mean the watermelon is there. 

Option E (blue_suitcase) has no connection to the story. 

Option F (blue_container) is where Charlotte moved the watermelon to, so this is a possibility. 

Option G (blue_bottle) is where the watermelon was initially, and Benjamin likes this bottle, but he moved the watermelon to the green_drawer. 

Option H (green_drawer) is where Benjamin moved the watermelon to, but it was then moved by Isabella to the blue_bucket and then by Charlotte to the blue_container. 

Option I (blue_bucket) is where Isabella moved the watermelon to, but it was then moved by Charlotte to the blue_container. 

Therefore, the answer is F. The watermelon is in the blue_container.
