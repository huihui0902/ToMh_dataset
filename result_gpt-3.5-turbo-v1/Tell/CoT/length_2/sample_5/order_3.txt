First, we need to determine where the watermelon actually is. According to the story, Benjamin moved the watermelon to the green_drawer, so the answer is H. 

Next, we need to determine who Isabella thinks Benjamin thinks the watermelon is. We know that Isabella moved the watermelon to the blue_bucket, but we don't have any information about what Isabella thinks Benjamin thinks. 

Finally, we need to determine where Isabella thinks Emma thinks Benjamin thinks the watermelon is. We know that Emma made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute before exiting, so she didn't have any opportunity to move the watermelon or witness any of the movements. Therefore, Isabella wouldn't have any reason to think that Emma has any thoughts about where the watermelon is. 

Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
