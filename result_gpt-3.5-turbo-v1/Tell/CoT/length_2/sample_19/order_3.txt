First, we need to determine where the carrot actually is. According to the story, the carrot was initially in the green_treasure_chest, but Noah moved it to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, the carrot is in the blue_suitcase.

Next, we need to determine what information Emily has access to. Emily was in the pantry with Noah and Benjamin, and she moved the carrot to the blue_drawer. She also privately told Sophia that the beans are in the blue_drawer. However, there is no mention of Emily having any private or public interactions with Noah.

Based on assumption (4), Emily would tend to trust Noah more than Benjamin since Noah exited the pantry after Benjamin. However, there is no information to suggest that Emily knows where Noah thinks the carrot is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Emily thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the carrot is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
