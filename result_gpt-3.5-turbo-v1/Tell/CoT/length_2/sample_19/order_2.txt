1. Noah moved the carrot to the blue_suitcase, so he knows where the carrot is.
2. Benjamin made no movements in the pantry, so he did not see where the carrot was moved to.
3. Emily moved the carrot to the blue_drawer after Noah left the pantry, so Benjamin could not have seen where the carrot was moved to.
4. Noah dislikes the corn, but this information is not relevant to the location of the carrot.
5. Benjamin publicly claimed that the beans is in the blue_bottle, but this information is not relevant to the location of the carrot.
6. Emily privately told Sophia that the beans is in the blue_drawer, but this information is not relevant to the location of the carrot.
7. Noah exited the pantry after Benjamin, so he would tend to trust Benjamin's thoughts more than his own.
8. Based on the above information, we can conclude that Noah would think that Benjamin thinks the carrot is in the blue_suitcase, where Noah moved it to.

Therefore, the answer is J. blue_suitcase.
