1. Benjamin moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase.
2. Alexander moved the grapes to the red_crate.
3. Owen moved the grapes to the blue_pantry.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Benjamin, Alexander, and Owen have all been in the same place as the grapes and have made movements with them. However, we cannot trust what they say about the location of the grapes. 

Therefore, we need to rely on the actual movements of the grapes. The grapes were first moved to the blue_suitcase by Benjamin, then to the red_crate by Alexander, and finally to the blue_pantry by Owen. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A. blue_pantry.
