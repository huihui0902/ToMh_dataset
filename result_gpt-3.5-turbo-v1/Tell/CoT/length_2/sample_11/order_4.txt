First, we need to determine where the grapes actually are. According to the story, the grapes were initially in the blue_pantry, then moved to the blue_suitcase by Benjamin, then to the red_crate by Alexander, and finally to the blue_pantry again by Owen. So, the grapes are currently in the blue_pantry.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the grapes are. Benjamin, Alexander, and Owen were all involved in moving the grapes, so they know where they are. Liam and Elizabeth did not move the grapes and did not have any private or public interactions with anyone who did, so they do not know where the grapes are.

Now, we need to determine who Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the grapes are. Since Elizabeth and Liam do not know where the grapes are, they cannot have any thoughts about their location. Benjamin moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase, but then left the workshop, so he may not know where they ended up. Owen moved the grapes to the blue_pantry, but Alexander moved them to the red_crate after that, so he may not trust Owen's knowledge of their current location.

Therefore, it is likely that Alexander thinks that Benjamin thinks the grapes are in the blue_suitcase, since that was the last place Benjamin was seen with them. Elizabeth and Liam do not factor into this thought process. So, the answer is E. blue_suitcase.
