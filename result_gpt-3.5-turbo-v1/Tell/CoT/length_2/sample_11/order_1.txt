1. Benjamin moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase.
2. Benjamin exited the workshop.
3. Benjamin lost his phone.
4. Alexander moved the grapes to the red_crate.
5. Owen moved the grapes to the blue_pantry.
6. Benjamin moved the watermelon to the red_pantry.
7. Benjamin publicly claimed that watermelon is in the green_pantry.
8. Owen privately told Benjamin that the watermelon is in the red_pantry.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Benjamin can only infer Owen's thought about the watermelon because they had a private interaction. However, we don't have any information about Benjamin inferring anyone's thought about the grapes. We also know that Benjamin tends to lie, so his public claim about the watermelon's location cannot be trusted.

Therefore, the answer to the question is A. blue_pantry, because that is the last place where Benjamin was seen with the grapes before he exited the workshop.
