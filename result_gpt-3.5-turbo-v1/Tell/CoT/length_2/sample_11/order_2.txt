First, we need to determine where the grapes actually are. According to the story, the grapes were initially in the blue_pantry, then moved to the blue_suitcase by Benjamin, then to the red_crate by Alexander, and finally to the blue_pantry again by Owen. Therefore, the grapes are currently in the blue_pantry.

Next, we need to determine what Benjamin thinks about the location of the grapes. Benjamin publicly claimed that the watermelon is in the green_pantry, which tells us nothing about his thoughts on the location of the grapes.

Now, we need to consider Liam's thoughts. Liam made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute, so he witnessed Benjamin moving the grapes to the blue_suitcase. However, we don't know if Liam had any private or public interactions with Benjamin after that. We do know that Liam likes the red_bucket, but this doesn't give us any information about his thoughts on the location of the grapes.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the grapes are. The answer is not provided in the given information.
