1. Emma, William, Isla, Ava and Nathan entered the sunroom.
2. The cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Emma made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
4. Emma exited the sunroom.
5. William made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
6. William exited the sunroom.
7. Isla moved the cherry to the red_bottle.
8. Isla exited the sunroom.
9. Ava moved the cherry to the green_basket.
10. Ava exited the sunroom.
11. Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase.
12. William saw a cat.
13. Nathan exited the sunroom.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Nathan witnessed all the movements before he exited the sunroom. Therefore, he knows that the cherry was initially in the blue suitcase, then Isla moved it to the red bottle, Ava moved it to the green basket, and finally, Nathan moved it to the blue suitcase again.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Nathan trusts William more than Emma, Isla, or Ava because William exited the sunroom after Nathan did. Therefore, Nathan may have heard William's claim about the cherry's location.

However, based on assumption (3), we know that an agent may lie about the cherry's location. Therefore, we cannot trust William's claim completely.

Based on assumption (2), we know that Nathan can only infer William's thought if they had a private or public interaction. However, there is no mention of any interaction between Nathan and William regarding the cherry's location.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Nathan really thinks the cherry is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
