First, we need to determine where Nathan put the cherry. According to statement 11, Nathan moved the cherry to the blue suitcase. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the cherry is. Isla moved the cherry to the red bottle, but she exited the sunroom before anyone else. Ava moved the cherry to the green basket, but she also exited the sunroom before anyone else. William saw a cat and did not witness any of the cherry movements. Emma did not move the cherry, but she was the last one to exit the sunroom and therefore knows where the cherry is.

Now, we need to determine who knows where the sweet potato is. Emma moved the sweet potato to the green cupboard, but Ava moved it to the blue cupboard and Isla moved it to the green bathtub. Ava privately told Isla that the sweet potato is in the green drawer, and Isla privately told William that the sweet potato is in the green bathtub. Therefore, William knows where the sweet potato is, but Emma, Ava, and Isla may have different beliefs about its location.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that Emma can infer William's thoughts because they were both in the waiting room together. However, we do not know if Ava or Isla can infer William's thoughts because they did not have any private or public interactions with him after he learned the location of the sweet potato.

Therefore, we can conclude that Emma thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is in the blue suitcase. The answer is G. blue suitcase.
