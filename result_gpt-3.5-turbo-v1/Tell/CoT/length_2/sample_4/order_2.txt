First, we need to determine where the cherry actually is. According to statement 2, the cherry is in the blue suitcase. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the cherry is. Isla moved the cherry to the red bottle, but she exited the sunroom before anyone else. Ava moved the cherry to the green basket, but she also exited the sunroom before anyone else. Nathan moved the cherry to the blue suitcase, but we don't know if he knows where it actually is. Emma and William did not move the cherry, but they were both in the sunroom before it was moved. 

Now, we need to consider the private communication between Ava and Isla about the sweet potato. Isla told William that the sweet potato is in the green bathtub, but we don't know if William trusts Isla or not. 

Based on the given assumptions, we know that William tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself. Since Nathan exited the sunroom after William, William may trust Nathan's claim about the cherry's location. Therefore, William may think that Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue suitcase. 

The answer is G. blue suitcase.
