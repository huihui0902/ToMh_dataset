First, we need to determine where the cherry actually is. According to statement 11, Nathan moved the cherry to the blue suitcase. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the cherry is. Isla moved the cherry to the red bottle, but we don't know if she knows where it is currently. William saw a cat and didn't make any movements related to the cherry, so we can assume he doesn't know where it is. Emma made no movements related to the cherry after it was moved to the blue suitcase, so we can assume she doesn't know where it is. Ava moved the cherry to the green basket, but we don't know if she knows where it is currently. Nathan moved the cherry to the blue suitcase, so we can assume he knows where it is.

Now, we need to determine who has interacted with whom and who trusts whom. According to statement 24, Ava privately told Isla that the sweet potato is in the green drawer. We don't know if Ava and William have interacted privately, so we can't use that information to determine where Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. However, we do know that Isla privately told William that the sweet potato is in the green bathtub. Since Isla and Ava have interacted privately, Ava may trust Isla's information about where the sweet potato is. 

Therefore, Ava may think that William thinks the cherry is in the green bathtub, since that is where Isla told him the sweet potato is. The answer is D. green bathtub.
