1. Emma, William, Isla, Ava and Nathan entered the sunroom.
2. The cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Emma made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
4. Emma exited the sunroom.
5. William made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute.
6. William exited the sunroom.
7. Isla moved the cherry to the red_bottle.
8. Isla exited the sunroom.
9. Ava moved the cherry to the green_basket.
10. Ava exited the sunroom.
11. Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase.
12. William saw a cat.
13. Nathan exited the sunroom.

Based on the assumption (1), we know that Nathan witnessed all the movements before he exited the sunroom. Therefore, he knows that the cherry is in the blue suitcase.

14. Emma, William, Isla, Ava and Nathan entered the waiting_room.
15. Emma, Ava and Isla entered the laundry.
16. The sweet_potato is in the green_drawer.
17. Emma moved the sweet_potato to the green_cupboard.
18. Emma exited the laundry.
19. Ava moved the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard.
20. Ava exited the laundry.
21. Isla moved the sweet_potato to the green_bathtub.
22. Isla exited the laundry.
23. Emma, Ava and Isla entered the waiting_room.
24. Ava privately told Isla that the sweet_potato is in the green_drawer.
25. Isla privately told William that the sweet_potato is in the green_bathtub.

Based on the assumption (2), we know that William can only infer the location of the sweet potato from Isla's private communication to him. Therefore, he knows that the sweet potato is in the green bathtub.

However, we cannot trust any of the characters' claims about the location of the cherry, as stated in assumption (3). Therefore, we cannot use any of the information from the previous steps to determine the location of the cherry.

Based on the assumption (4), we know that William trusts Nathan more than Emma, Ava, or Isla, as Nathan exited the sunroom last. Therefore, we can assume that William would believe Nathan's knowledge of the cherry's location over the others.

Based on the assumption (5), we know that any public claims about the cherry's location can be heard by all the characters in the same place. However, there are no public claims made about the cherry's location.

Therefore, the answer to the question is G. blue_suitcase, as that is the only location that we can determine with certainty based on the given information and assumptions.
