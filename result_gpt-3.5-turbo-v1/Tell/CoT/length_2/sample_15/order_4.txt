First, we need to determine where the potato actually is. According to the story, the potato was moved to the blue_crate by Nathan. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the potato is. Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_cupboard, but we know that this is not true. Nathan privately told Noah that the potato is in the blue_crate, so we can assume that Noah knows where the potato is. 

Now, we need to determine who Nathan thinks Ava thinks Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is. Since Nathan knows where the potato is, he would not be thinking about where it is located. However, he may be thinking about what Ava and Noah think about where the potato is located. 

We know that Ava likes the red_bucket, but we don't have any information about what she thinks about the location of the potato. We also don't have any information about what Noah thinks about the location of the potato, except that he knows where it is. 

Finally, we come to Charlotte. Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_cupboard, but we know that this is not true. We also know that Charlotte likes the green_bucket, but we don't have any information about what she thinks about the location of the potato. 

Based on the information given, we cannot determine where Nathan thinks Ava thinks Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is located. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
