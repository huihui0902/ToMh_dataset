First, we need to determine where the potato actually is. According to the story, the potato is in the blue_crate (as Nathan privately told Noah). 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the potato is. Nathan, Noah, and Charlotte know where the potato is. Ava and Chloe do not know where the potato is.

Now, we need to determine who Ava thinks Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is. Since Ava does not know where the potato is, she cannot make an accurate guess about where Charlotte thinks the potato is. However, we do know that Nathan privately told Noah that the potato is in the blue_crate. Therefore, it is likely that Noah thinks the potato is in the blue_crate. 

Based on this information, we can eliminate all answer choices except for D. Therefore, the answer is D. blue_crate.
