First, we need to determine where the potato actually is. According to the story, the potato is in the blue_crate (as stated by Nathan in private to Noah). 

Next, we need to determine what Charlotte publicly claimed about the location of the potato. According to the story, Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_cupboard. 

Now, we need to determine where Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is. Since Noah was told by Nathan that the potato is in the blue_crate, he knows that Charlotte's public claim is false. However, he doesn't know if Charlotte is lying or simply mistaken. 

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Noah can only infer Charlotte's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. According to the story, Noah and Charlotte were both in the garden at some point, but there is no indication that they had any private or public interactions there. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is with certainty. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
