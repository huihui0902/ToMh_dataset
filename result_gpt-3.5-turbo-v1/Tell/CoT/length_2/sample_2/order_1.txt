Based on the given assumptions, we know that Owen can only infer where the onion is if he has had a private or public interaction with someone who knows where the onion is. We also know that Owen tends to lie, so we cannot trust what he says publicly. However, we can trust what he says privately to Emily.

According to the story, Owen privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_crate. Therefore, the answer is option O, blue_crate.
