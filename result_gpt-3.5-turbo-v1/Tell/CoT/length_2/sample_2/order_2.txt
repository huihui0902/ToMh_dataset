25. Isabella publicly claimed that onion is in the green_cupboard.
26. Owen privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_crate.

Based on the assumption that an agent can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions, we know that Emily can infer Owen's thought because he privately told her where the onion is. 

Based on the assumption that an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than themselves, we know that Emily trusts Owen's information because he exited the porch after her.

Therefore, Emily thinks that Owen thinks the onion is in the blue_crate (option O).
