Based on the story and assumptions, we can eliminate some options. We know that the onion was initially in the red_crate, and then moved to the red_drawer by Owen, then to the red_bottle by Emily, and finally back to the red_crate by Sophia. Isabella moved the onion to the blue_crate, but we cannot trust her claim that the onion is in the green_cupboard. Owen privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_crate, which is the most reliable information we have.

Therefore, the answer is O. blue_crate.
