7. Aiden moved the persimmon to the green_treasure_chest.
8. Aiden exited the closet.

Based on assumption (4), Amelia would trust Aiden's opinion more than Sophia's or Owen's since Aiden exited the closet last. However, we still don't have any information about Aiden's thoughts on the persimmon's location.

9. Ella made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute.
10. Ella exited the closet.

Based on assumption (4), Amelia would trust Ella's opinion more than Sophia's or Owen's since Ella exited the closet after Sophia and Owen but before Aiden. However, we still don't have any information about Ella's thoughts on the persimmon's location.

11. Amelia moved the persimmon to the blue_pantry.

24. Amelia, Aiden, and Ella entered the waiting_room.
25. Sophia likes the red_drawer.
26. Ella publicly claimed that the persimmon is in the blue_bottle.
