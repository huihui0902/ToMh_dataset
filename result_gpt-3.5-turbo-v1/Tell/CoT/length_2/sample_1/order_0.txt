Based on the story and assumptions, we can eliminate some options. We know that the persimmon was initially in the blue_pantry, but it was moved by Aiden to the green_treasure_chest and then by Amelia to the blue_pantry again. However, we also know that Ella publicly claimed that the persimmon is in the blue_bottle, which could be a lie. Amelia privately told Ella that the persimmon is in the red_box, which could also be a lie. 

We cannot trust the public claims or private communication completely, but we can use them to make some deductions. Since Amelia moved the persimmon to the blue_pantry and then privately told Ella that it is in the red_box, we can assume that the persimmon is not in the blue_pantry or the green_treasure_chest. 

We also know that Aiden saw a monkey, which could have distracted him from moving the persimmon again. Therefore, we can eliminate the options that involve Aiden moving the persimmon again, such as green_treasure_chest and green_drawer. 

Based on the exit order, we can assume that Amelia exited the closet last, so we can trust her more than the other agents. Therefore, we can assume that the persimmon is in the red_box, as Amelia privately told Ella. 

Therefore, the answer is H. red_box.
