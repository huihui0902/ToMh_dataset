25. Sophia likes the red_drawer.
26. Ella publicly claimed that persimmon is in the blue_bottle.
27. Amelia privately told Ella that the persimmon is in the red_box.

Based on the assumption that Ella can only infer Aiden's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions, we can eliminate options that Aiden has not been in or has not interacted with Ella. 

We know that Aiden moved the persimmon to the green_treasure_chest and then exited the closet. Therefore, Ella cannot infer Aiden's thought after he left the closet. 

We also know that Amelia privately told Ella that the persimmon is in the red_box. Therefore, Ella knows that Amelia thinks the persimmon is in the red_box. 

However, we do not have any information about what Owen thinks about the persimmon's location. Therefore, we cannot infer what Amelia thinks Owen thinks about the persimmon's location. 

Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
