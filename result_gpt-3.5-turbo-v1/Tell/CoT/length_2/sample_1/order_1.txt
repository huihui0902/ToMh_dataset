1. Sophia, Owen, Aiden, Ella and Amelia entered the closet.
2. The persimmon is in the blue_pantry.
3. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute.
4. Sophia exited the closet.
5. Owen made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute.
6. Owen exited the closet.

Based on the assumptions, we know that Owen can only infer the persimmon's location if he has interacted with someone who knows where it is or if he was in the same place as the persimmon. However, he did not interact with anyone and did not move in the closet, so he cannot know where the persimmon is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen thinks the persimmon is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
