First, Liam entered the cellar and made no movements, so he did not interact with the sweet_potato. Then, Hannah entered the cellar and also made no movements, so she did not interact with the sweet_potato either. Therefore, we can conclude that Hannah does not have any information about the sweet_potato's location.

Since we do not have any information about where Liam thinks the sweet_potato is, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Liam thinks the sweet_potato is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given story and assumptions.
