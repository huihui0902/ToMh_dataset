Based on the story and assumption (1), we know that the sweet_potato was in the red_drawer when Liam, Hannah, Emma, Mila, and Evelyn entered the cellar. Mila moved the sweet_potato to the red_crate before exiting the cellar. Therefore, the sweet_potato is in the red_crate.

13. Liam, Hannah, Emma, Mila, and Evelyn entered the waiting_room.
14. Liam, Mila, and Evelyn entered the cellar.
15. The sweet_potato is in the red_crate.
16. Liam made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
17. Liam exited the cellar.
18. Mila moved the sweet_potato to the red_container.

Based on the story and assumption (1), we know that the sweet_potato was in the red_container when Liam, Mila, and Evelyn entered the cellar. Mila moved the sweet_potato to the red_container before exiting the cellar. Therefore, the sweet_potato is in the red_container.

22. Liam, Mila, and Evelyn entered the waiting_room.
23. Mila publicly claimed that the sweet_potato is in the blue_container.
24. Evelyn privately told Mila that the sweet_potato is in the blue_suitcase.

Based on the story and assumption (2) and (3), we know that Mila and Evelyn have interacted privately, and Mila made a public claim about the sweet_potato's location. However, we cannot trust Mila's claim because of assumption (3). We also know that the sweet_potato was in the red_container before Mila and Evelyn entered the waiting_room, so the sweet_potato is not in the blue_container. Evelyn privately told Mila that the sweet_potato is in the blue_suitcase, but we cannot trust this information because of assumption (3).

Therefore, based on the story and assumptions, the sweet_potato is in the red_container (option M).
