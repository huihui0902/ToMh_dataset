First, we need to determine where the sweet_potato actually is. According to the story, it was moved from the red_drawer to the red_crate and then to the red_container. Therefore, the sweet_potato is in the red_container.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the sweet_potato is. Mila moved the sweet_potato to the red_crate and then to the red_container, and Evelyn privately told Mila that the sweet_potato is in the blue_suitcase. Therefore, Mila and Evelyn know where the sweet_potato is.

Now, we need to determine who Hannah thinks Liam thinks the sweet_potato is. According to the story, Liam made no movements in the cellar and stayed there for 1 minute before exiting. Hannah also made no movements in the cellar and stayed there for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Hannah and Liam have not been in the same place and have not had any interactions. As per assumption (2), Hannah cannot infer Liam's thought.

Finally, we need to determine where Evelyn thinks Hannah thinks Liam thinks the sweet_potato is. According to the story, Evelyn privately told Mila that the sweet_potato is in the blue_suitcase. Therefore, Evelyn knows where the sweet_potato is. However, there is no information about Hannah's thoughts on the sweet_potato's location. Therefore, we cannot determine where Evelyn thinks Hannah thinks Liam thinks the sweet_potato is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
