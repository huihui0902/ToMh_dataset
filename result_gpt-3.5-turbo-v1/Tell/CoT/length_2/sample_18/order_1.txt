1. Liam entered the cellar with the others.
2. The sweet_potato was in the red_drawer.
3. Liam made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
4. Liam exited the cellar.
5. Liam did not witness Mila moving the sweet_potato to the red_crate.
6. Hannah, Emma, and Evelyn also made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting.
7. Mila moved the sweet_potato to the red_crate after Liam exited.
8. Liam, Mila, and Evelyn re-entered the cellar later.
9. The sweet_potato was now in the red_crate.
10. Liam made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute.
11. Liam exited the cellar.
12. Mila moved the sweet_potato to the red_container after Liam exited.
13. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting.
14. Mila publicly claimed that the sweet_potato is in the blue_container.
15. Evelyn privately told Mila that the sweet_potato is in the blue_suitcase.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that Liam can only infer Mila's thought about the sweet_potato's location if they had a private interaction. Since there is no mention of Liam and Mila having a private interaction, we cannot determine where Liam thinks the sweet_potato is. Therefore, the answer is unknown.
