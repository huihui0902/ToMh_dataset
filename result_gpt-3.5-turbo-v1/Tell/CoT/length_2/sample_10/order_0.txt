First, we know that the persimmon was initially in the blue_crate (statement 2). Then, Charlotte moved it to the red_crate (statement 5), followed by Evelyn moving it to the blue_cupboard (statement 7), and then Amelia moved it to the green_pantry (statement 9). 

We don't have any further information about the persimmon's location after Amelia moved it to the green_pantry. Therefore, we cannot determine its current location with certainty. 

The answer is: It is impossible to determine the current location of the persimmon based on the given information.
