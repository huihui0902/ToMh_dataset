Based on the assumptions given, we know that Ava can only infer the persimmon's location based on what she witnessed or what others told her. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say. However, we can use the exit order to determine who Ava might trust more.

Ava exited the bathroom before Charlotte, Evelyn, Amelia, and Benjamin. Therefore, she might trust their claims less than those who exited the bathroom after her. Benjamin and Evelyn both exited the office after Ava, so she might trust their claims more than Charlotte and Amelia.

According to the story, Charlotte moved the persimmon to the red_crate, Evelyn moved it to the blue_cupboard, and Amelia moved it to the green_pantry. Benjamin made no movements, so he did not move the persimmon. Based on this information, we cannot determine where Ava thinks the persimmon is.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: Insufficient information to determine where Ava thinks the persimmon is.
