First, we need to determine where the persimmon is currently located. According to the story, the persimmon was moved by Charlotte to the red_crate, then by Evelyn to the blue_cupboard, and finally by Amelia to the green_pantry. Therefore, the persimmon is currently in the green_pantry.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the persimmon is. Ava, Charlotte, and Benjamin were not present when the persimmon was moved to the green_pantry, so they do not know its current location. Evelyn was present when the persimmon was moved to the blue_cupboard, but she did not exit the bathroom with Ava, Charlotte, and Benjamin, so they do not know if she knows the current location of the persimmon. Amelia was the last person to move the persimmon, so she knows its current location.

Now, we need to determine who Benjamin thinks knows the current location of the persimmon. Benjamin did not witness any of the movements of the persimmon, so he does not know its current location. However, he knows that Evelyn was in the bathroom with Charlotte and Ava before they exited and that she later entered the office with him and Ava. He also knows that Evelyn had a private conversation with Amelia in which she revealed the location of the onion. Based on assumption (2), Benjamin can infer that Evelyn knows the current location of the persimmon. 

Finally, we need to determine where Benjamin thinks Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is. Based on assumption (4), Benjamin would trust Evelyn's knowledge of the persimmon's location since she exited the bathroom after Ava and Charlotte. Therefore, he would assume that Charlotte also trusts Evelyn's knowledge. Based on assumption (3), we cannot assume that any of the characters are telling the truth about their thoughts, so we cannot use the information about the onion's location to infer anything about the persimmon's location. Therefore, we can conclude that Benjamin thinks Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is in the green_pantry, which is the correct answer choice K.
