First, Lily did not move the melon at all, so she does not know where it is currently located. However, she knows that Amelia moved it to the green_bucket, Jacob moved it to the green_drawer, Evelyn moved it to the green_bottle, and Ava moved it back to the blue_treasure_chest. 

Next, Lily moved the cherry to the red_box, but then she left the dining_room. Jacob then moved the cherry to the blue_bottle, and Amelia moved it to the red_envelope. 

Finally, Jacob publicly claimed that the cherry is in the red_box, but Amelia privately told Jacob that the cherry is in the red_envelope. 

Based on these events and assumptions, Lily would likely think that Jacob thinks the melon is in the green_drawer, as that is where he last moved it before leaving the garden. However, it is important to note that Lily cannot be certain of Jacob's actual thoughts, as all agents tend to lie. 

Therefore, the answer is (E) green_drawer.
