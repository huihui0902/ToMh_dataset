First, we need to determine where the melon actually is. According to statement 2, the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the melon is. Lily did not move the melon and left before anyone else, so she does not know where the melon is. Amelia, Jacob, Evelyn, and Ava all moved the melon, so they know where it is. 

We also need to consider who has interacted with whom. Lily, Jacob, and Amelia were in the dining_room together and moved the cherry, but Lily left before Jacob and Amelia made their public and private claims about the cherry's location. Therefore, Lily does not know about the claims. Jacob and Amelia both know where the cherry is, but they have conflicting claims about its location. 

Now, we can determine where Ava thinks Evelyn thinks Lily thinks Jacob thinks the melon is. Since Ava moved the melon last and it was already in the blue_treasure_chest, she knows where it is. Evelyn moved the melon before Ava, so she also knows where it is. Lily does not know where the melon is, so she cannot have a thought about its location. Jacob moved the melon before Evelyn, so he also knows where it is. 

Therefore, Ava thinks that Evelyn thinks that Jacob thinks that the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest. The answer is B.
