1. William moved the lettuce to the blue_cupboard, but we don't know what he thinks about the location of the lettuce.
2. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the living_room for 1 minute, so she doesn't have any information about the lettuce's location.
3. Charlotte moved the lettuce to the blue_bathtub, but we don't know what she thinks about the location of the lettuce.
4. Aiden moved the lettuce to the red_box, but we don't know what he thinks about the location of the lettuce.
5. Isla moved the lettuce to the green_pantry, but we don't know if she really thinks that's where the lettuce is.
6. William publicly claimed that the apple is in the blue_container, but we don't know if he's telling the truth or lying.
7. William dislikes the apple, but we don't know if that affects his claim about the apple's location.
8. Amelia privately told William that the apple is in the blue_suitcase, but we don't know if she's telling the truth or lying.

Based on the given assumptions, we can infer that Isla can only trust the information from William and Amelia, as they have had private interactions. However, we don't know if Isla trusts them or not. Therefore, we cannot determine where Isla really thinks the lettuce is. The answer is unknown.
