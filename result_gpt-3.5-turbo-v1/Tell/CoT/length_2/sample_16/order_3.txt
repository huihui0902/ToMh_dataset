First, we need to determine where the cucumber actually is. According to the story, Benjamin moved the cucumber to the red_container, so the cucumber is in the red_container.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the cucumber is. Benjamin knows where the cucumber is because he moved it to the red_container. Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_basket, so she also knows where it is. Isla and Ava made no movements related to the cucumber, so we don't know if they know where it is. Evelyn made no movements related to the cucumber, but she privately told Benjamin where the orange is.

Now, we need to determine who knows what Benjamin thinks about the cucumber. According to the story, Benjamin dislikes the asparagus, but there is no information about what he thinks about the cucumber. However, we do know that Benjamin likes the green_treasure_chest.

Finally, we need to determine where Evelyn thinks Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks the cucumber is. We know that Charlotte publicly claimed that the orange is in the green_bottle, but there is no information about what she thinks about the cucumber. Isla moved the orange to the green_bathtub, so she knows where it is, but there is no information about what she thinks about the cucumber. Evelyn privately told Benjamin that the orange is in the green_bucket, so she knows where the orange is and what Benjamin thinks about it. However, there is no information about what Evelyn thinks Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks about the cucumber.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Evelyn thinks Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks the cucumber is. The answer is not provided in the story and assumptions given.
