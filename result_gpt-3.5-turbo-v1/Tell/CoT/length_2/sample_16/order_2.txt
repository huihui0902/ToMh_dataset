First, we need to determine where the cucumber actually is. According to the story, the cucumber was initially in the green_crate, but Benjamin moved it to the red_container. Therefore, the cucumber is in the red_container.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the cucumber is. Benjamin knows where the cucumber is because he moved it to the red_container. Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_basket, but it is unclear if she knows where the cucumber currently is. Isla made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute, so she does not know where the cucumber is. Ava made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute, so she also does not know where the cucumber is. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute, so she does not know where the cucumber is either.

Now, we need to determine who Charlotte trusts. Charlotte made no movements and stayed in the lounge for 1 minute, so she does not know where the cucumber is. However, she publicly claimed that the orange is in the green_bottle, which may or may not be true. Isla moved the orange to the green_bathtub, so she knows where the orange is but it is unclear if Charlotte trusts her. Evelyn moved the orange to the green_bucket and privately told Benjamin that the orange is in the green_bucket, so Charlotte may or may not trust her.

Finally, we need to determine where Benjamin thinks the cucumber is. According to the story, Benjamin dislikes the asparagus and likes the green_treasure_chest, but there is no information about where he thinks the cucumber is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks the cucumber is.

Answer: Cannot be determined.
