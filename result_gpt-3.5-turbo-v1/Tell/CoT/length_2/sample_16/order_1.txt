1. Benjamin dislikes asparagus, which is not related to the location of the cucumber.
2. The cucumber is initially in the green_crate, but Benjamin moves it to the red_container. Therefore, Benjamin knows that the cucumber is not in the green_crate anymore.
3. Charlotte moves the cucumber to the red_basket, but we cannot infer whether Benjamin knows about this movement or not.
4. Benjamin exits the workshop before Charlotte moves the cucumber to the red_basket, so he does not know about this movement.
5. Therefore, Benjamin thinks the cucumber is in the red_container, as he was the last one to move it and he did not witness any other movements. The answer is C. red_container.
