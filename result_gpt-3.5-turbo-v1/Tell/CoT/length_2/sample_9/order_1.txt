First, we know that Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle. However, we don't know if he actually thinks the apple is in the green_bottle or if he's lying. 

Next, we can use assumption (4) to infer that Jack may trust the agents who exited the den after him (Evelyn and Hannah) more than the agents who exited before him (Ella and Amelia). 

However, we don't have any information about Jack's interactions with any of the other agents, so we can't use assumption (2) to infer his thoughts based on their interactions. 

Therefore, based solely on the given information, we can only conclude that Jack publicly claimed the apple is in the green_bottle, but we don't know for sure if he actually thinks it's there or if he's lying. 

So the answer is D. green_bottle.
