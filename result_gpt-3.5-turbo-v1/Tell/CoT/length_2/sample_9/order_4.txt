First, we need to determine where the apple actually is. According to statement 2, the apple is in the green_pantry.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the apple is. Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle, so he knows where it is. However, he may not have shared this information with anyone else.

Ella made no movements in the den and did not interact with anyone who knows where the apple is, so she does not know where it is.

Amelia also made no movements in the den and did not interact with anyone who knows where the apple is, so she does not know where it is either.

Evelyn made no movements in the den and did not interact with anyone who knows where the apple is, so she does not know where it is either.

Hannah made no movements in the den and did not interact with anyone who knows where the apple is, so she does not know where it is either.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the onion is. According to statement 15, the onion is in the red_drawer.

Ella moved the onion to the red_pantry and privately knows that the onion is in the red_pantry, according to statement 25.

Amelia made no movements in the sunroom and did not interact with anyone who knows where the onion is, so she does not know where it is.

Evelyn made no movements in the sunroom and did not interact with anyone who knows where the onion is, so she does not know where it is either.

Based on the given assumptions, we know that Amelia can only infer what someone else thinks if she has been in the same place as that person or has had a private or public interaction with them. Amelia was in the sunroom with Ella and Evelyn, so she could have overheard their private conversation about the onion.

According to statement 24, Ella publicly claimed that the onion is in the green_treasure_chest. However, we know from statement 19 that Ella actually likes the green_bucket, so she may have lied about the location of the onion.

Based on this information, we can conclude that Amelia thinks that Ella thinks that Evelyn thinks that Jack thinks the apple is in the green_pantry (option A).
