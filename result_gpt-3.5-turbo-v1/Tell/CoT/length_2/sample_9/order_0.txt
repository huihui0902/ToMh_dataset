First, we know that Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle. So, the apple is either in the green_bottle or has been moved from there. 

Next, we know that no one else made any movements in the den, so the apple must have been moved after everyone left the den. 

We also know that no one mentioned the apple's location in the waiting_room or the sunroom. 

Therefore, the only information we have about the apple's location is that it was moved to the green_bottle by Jack. So, the answer is D. green_bottle.
