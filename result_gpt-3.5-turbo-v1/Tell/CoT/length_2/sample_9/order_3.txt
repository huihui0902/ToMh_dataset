First, we need to determine where the apple actually is. According to statement 2, the apple is in the green_pantry.

Next, we need to determine who moved the apple. According to statement 7, Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle.

Now, we need to determine who knows where the apple is. Since Jack moved the apple, he knows where it is. However, we are looking for where Ella thinks Evelyn thinks Jack thinks the apple is.

According to statement 25, Evelyn privately told Ella that the onion is in the red_pantry. This means that Ella knows where the onion is, but it doesn't necessarily mean that she knows where the apple is.

We also know that Ella likes the green_bucket (statement 19), but this doesn't give us any information about where she thinks the apple is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Ella thinks Evelyn thinks Jack thinks the apple is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
