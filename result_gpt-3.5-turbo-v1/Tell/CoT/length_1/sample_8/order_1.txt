14. Benjamin privately told Sophia that the lettuce is in the red_bucket.
15. Isla lost his phone.
16. Isla privately told Alexander that the lettuce is in the red_pantry.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Isla can only infer the location of the lettuce if he had a private or public interaction with someone who knows the location. We also know that Isla tends to lie, so we cannot trust what he says to others. 

From the story, we know that Isla did not move the lettuce and did not have a private interaction with anyone who moved the lettuce. However, we do know that Isla privately told Alexander that the lettuce is in the red_pantry. 

Therefore, Isla really thinks that the lettuce is in the red_pantry. The answer is L. red_pantry.
