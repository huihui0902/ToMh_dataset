First, we need to determine where the potato actually is. According to the story, the potato was moved from the blue_bathtub to the blue_pantry by Avery, and then from the blue_pantry to the green_cupboard by Jacob. Therefore, the potato is in the green_cupboard.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the potato is. Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub, but we know that this is a lie. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle, but we don't know if Jacob believes him or not. Carter made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute, so he doesn't know where the potato is. Jackson made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute, so he also doesn't know where the potato is. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute, so he doesn't know where the potato is either.

Now, we need to determine who Jackson thinks Alexander thinks Jacob thinks Carter thinks the potato is. Since Jackson doesn't know where the potato is, he can't make any assumptions about where anyone else thinks it is. However, we do know that Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle. Therefore, if Jackson trusts Alexander and believes that Jacob believes him, then he might think that Jacob thinks the potato is in the blue_bottle. However, we don't know for sure what Jackson thinks.

Based on the information given, the answer to the question is C. blue_bottle, but this is only a possibility and not a definite answer.
