10. Jackson exited the study.
11. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
12. Alexander exited the study.
13. Carter, Avery, Jacob, Jackson, and Alexander entered the waiting_room.
14. Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub.
15. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Carter witnessed everything that happened in the study before he exited. We also know that he did not make any movements while he was in the study. However, we do not know if he had any private or public interactions with the other agents.

We also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say about the location of the potato. Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub, but we cannot be sure if he is telling the truth.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Carter really thinks the potato is based on the information given. The answer is unknown.
