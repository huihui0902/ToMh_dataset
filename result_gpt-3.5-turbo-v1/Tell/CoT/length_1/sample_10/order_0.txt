1. Carter entered the study and made no movements before exiting. We don't know if he saw the potato or not, so we can't eliminate any options yet.
2. The potato is in the blue_bathtub. This information is important because it tells us where the potato was initially located.
3. Avery moved the potato to the blue_pantry. This means that the potato is no longer in the blue_bathtub.
4. Jacob moved the potato to the green_cupboard. This means that the potato is no longer in the blue_pantry.
5. Jackson made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute. We don't know if he saw the potato or not, so we can't eliminate any options yet.
6. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute. We don't know if he saw the potato or not, so we can't eliminate any options yet.
7. Carter, Avery, Jacob, Jackson and Alexander entered the waiting_room.
8. Jacob publicly claimed that potato is in the blue_bathtub. This is a lie because we know that the potato was moved to the blue_pantry and then to the green_cupboard.
9. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle. This is important because it tells us where Alexander thinks the potato is.

Based on the information we have, we can eliminate options A, E, and N because we know the potato is not in the blue_bathtub or blue_pantry anymore. We can also eliminate options B and D because there is no evidence that the potato was moved to a green_drawer or green_treasure_chest. We can eliminate options F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, and O because there is no evidence that the potato was moved to any of those places.

Therefore, the answer is C. The potato is in the blue_bottle according to Alexander's private communication with Jacob.
