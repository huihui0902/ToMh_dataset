First, we need to determine where the potato actually is. According to statement 2, the potato is in the blue_bathtub.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the potato is. Avery moved the potato to the blue_pantry, but it is unclear if anyone else knows this. Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub, but we know this is not true. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle, so we know that Alexander knows where the potato is.

Now we need to determine who Alexander thinks Jacob thinks Carter thinks the potato is. According to statement 14, Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub. However, we know that Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle. Therefore, Alexander thinks that Jacob thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub, even though he knows this is not true.

So the answer is A. blue_bathtub.
