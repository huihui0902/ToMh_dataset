First, we need to determine where the carrot actually is. According to the story, Hannah moved the carrot to the red_basket before exiting the hall. However, Charlotte publicly claimed that the carrot is in the green_envelope, and Hannah privately told Charlotte that the carrot is in the blue_container. Since we know that every agent tends to lie, we cannot trust either of their statements. Therefore, we cannot determine the actual location of the carrot.

Next, we need to determine the relationship between Jack, Hannah, and William. According to the story, all three of them entered the hall together, but we do not know if they had any private or public interactions with each other. Therefore, we cannot determine what Hannah thinks William thinks about the location of the carrot.

Finally, we need to determine where Jack thinks Hannah thinks William thinks the carrot is. Since we do not have any information about their interactions or thoughts, we cannot determine the answer to this question. Therefore, the correct answer is not given in the options provided.
