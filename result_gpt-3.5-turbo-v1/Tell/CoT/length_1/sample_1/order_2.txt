First, we need to determine where the carrot actually is. According to statement 3, the carrot is in the red_basket. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the carrot is. According to statement 12, Noah moved the carrot to the green_envelope, but we know from statement 3 that this is not true. Hannah moved the carrot to the red_basket, but we don't know if anyone else knows this. 

According to statement 17, Charlotte publicly claimed that the carrot is in the green_envelope, but we know this is not true. 

According to statement 18, Hannah privately told Charlotte that the carrot is in the blue_container. However, we don't know if anyone else knows this. 

Now we need to determine where Hannah thinks William thinks the carrot is. We know that William made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute before exiting. We don't have any information about William's thoughts or interactions with Hannah. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks William thinks the carrot is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
