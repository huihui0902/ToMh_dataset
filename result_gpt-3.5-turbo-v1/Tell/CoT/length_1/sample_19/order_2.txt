14. Ella publicly claimed that the green pepper is in the red pantry.
15. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green pepper is in the red drawer.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Lily can only infer Logan's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't affect their actual thought.

Lily was in the den with Logan when he moved the green pepper to the blue crate. Therefore, Lily knows that Logan knows the green pepper is in the blue crate. However, we don't know where Lily thinks Logan thinks the green pepper is.

We do know that Ella publicly claimed that the green pepper is in the red pantry, but we can't assume that Lily believes her. We also know that Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green pepper is in the red drawer, but we don't know if Lily knows about this private conversation.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Lily thinks Logan thinks the green pepper is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
