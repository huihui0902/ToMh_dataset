13. Abigail, Lily, Ella, Logan, and Elizabeth entered the waiting room.
14. Ella publicly claimed that the green pepper is in the red pantry.
15. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green pepper is in the red drawer.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Elizabeth can only infer what Ella thinks if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

From the story, we know that Ella publicly claimed that the green pepper is in the red pantry, but we don't know if this is true or not. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green pepper is in the red drawer, so we can assume that Elizabeth knows where the green pepper actually is.

However, we don't have any information about what Lily or Logan think about the location of the green pepper. Therefore, we cannot determine where Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green pepper is.

The answer is: Insufficient information to determine.
