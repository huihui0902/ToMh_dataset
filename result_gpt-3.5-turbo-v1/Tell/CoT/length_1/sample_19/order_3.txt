Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Ella knows that Logan moved the green pepper to the blue crate because she witnessed Logan's movements before exiting the den. However, we cannot infer where Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green pepper is because there is no information given about any interactions or conversations between Lily and Logan. Therefore, the answer to the question is not provided in the story and assumptions given.
