First, we know that the onion was originally in the green_crate, but Emily moved it to the blue_pantry and Liam moved it to the red_drawer. 

Then, Avery privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_bottle, while Liam privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the blue_treasure_chest. 

We cannot trust what Avery and Liam said, as every agent tends to lie. 

However, we can use the exit order to determine who to trust. Avery, Elizabeth, and Lily all made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, they cannot be trusted as they did not witness the onion being moved to the red_drawer. 

Emily and Liam both exited the hallway after Avery, Elizabeth, and Lily. Therefore, they can be trusted more than the others. 

Based on this information, we can conclude that the onion is most likely in the red_drawer, as that is where Liam moved it to and he exited the hallway after Avery, Elizabeth, and Lily. 

Therefore, the answer is E. red_drawer.
