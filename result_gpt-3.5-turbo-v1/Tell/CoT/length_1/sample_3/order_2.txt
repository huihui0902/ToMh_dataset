First, we need to determine where the onion actually is. According to the story, Emily moved the onion from the green_crate to the blue_pantry, and then Liam moved it from the blue_pantry to the red_drawer. Therefore, the onion is in the red_drawer.

Next, we need to determine who Avery trusts the most. Since Avery exited the hallway before Elizabeth and Lily, she would trust them more than Emily and Liam. However, since Avery did not have any private or public interactions with Lily, she cannot infer where Lily thinks the onion is.

Finally, we need to determine where Avery might think the onion is based on the information she received from Emily. Emily told Avery that the onion is in the blue_bottle, but we know that this is a lie since the onion is actually in the red_drawer. Therefore, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Lily thinks the onion is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
