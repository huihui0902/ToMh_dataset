First, Emily moved the onion from the green_crate to the blue_pantry. Then, Liam moved the onion from the blue_pantry to the red_drawer. Avery, Elizabeth, and Lily made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute before exiting. 

Later, Avery privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_bottle, while Liam privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the blue_treasure_chest. 

Based on the assumptions given, Emily can only infer Avery's thought if they had a private or public interaction. Since Avery privately told Emily about the onion's location, Emily can trust Avery's information. However, Emily cannot infer what Lily thinks about the onion's location since there is no interaction or communication between Emily and Lily. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is B. Emily does not have any information about what Avery thinks Lily thinks about the onion's location.
