First, we need to determine where the onion actually is. According to statement 3, the onion is in the red_crate. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the onion is. According to statement 11, Elizabeth moved the onion to the green_bucket, but according to statement 17, Jack privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the red_crate. We know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what Jack told Elizabeth. Therefore, only Owen knows where the onion actually is, as stated in statement 13.

Now, we need to determine who Liam thinks Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is. According to statement 16, Liam privately told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket. However, we know that the onion is actually in the red_crate, so Liam's statement is a lie. Therefore, we cannot trust Liam's statement.

Based on the given information, we cannot determine where Liam thinks Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
