First, we need to determine where the onion actually is. According to statement 3, the onion is in the red_crate. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the onion is. According to statement 11, Jack privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the red_crate. So, Elizabeth knows where the onion is.

Now, we need to determine where Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is. According to statement 12, Elizabeth exited the cellar before Owen moved the onion to the red_crate. Therefore, Owen did not know that the onion was in the red_crate when Elizabeth left the cellar. 

According to statement 16, Liam privately told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket. However, Elizabeth was not present for this conversation and does not know that Liam told Noah this information. Therefore, Elizabeth cannot assume that Owen knows that the onion is in the green_bucket.

According to assumption 2, Elizabeth can only infer Owen's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. However, there is no statement indicating that Elizabeth and Owen have been in the same place or had any interactions. Therefore, we cannot determine where Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
