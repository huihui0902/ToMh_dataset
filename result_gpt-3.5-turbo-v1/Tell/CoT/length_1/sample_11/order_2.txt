1. Ava moved the pear to the green_envelope before exiting the lounge.
2. Avery moved the pear to the red_pantry before exiting the lounge.
3. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the lounge for 1 minute before exiting.
4. Mila made no movements and stayed in the lounge for 1 minute before exiting.
5. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the lounge for 1 minute before exiting.
6. Mila dislikes the pear.
7. Isabella publicly claimed that the pear is in the green_envelope.
8. Sophia privately told Isabella that the pear is in the blue_crate.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Ava can infer Sophia's thought only if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that Ava tends to lie, so what she tells others doesn't affect her actual thought. 

Ava was in the lounge with Sophia, but we don't know if they had any interactions. However, we do know that Sophia privately told Isabella that the pear is in the blue_crate. Since Ava tends to lie, we cannot assume that she believes Isabella's claim that the pear is in the green_envelope. Therefore, Ava may think that Sophia believes the pear is in the blue_crate. 

The answer is F. blue_crate.
