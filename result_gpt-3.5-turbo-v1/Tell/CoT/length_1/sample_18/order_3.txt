Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Aiden can only know what Nathan thinks about the cabbage if they were in the same place or had a private or public interaction. We also know that Aiden tends to lie, so we cannot trust what he says about his own thoughts.

From the story, we know that Nathan moved the cabbage to the red_box and then exited the master_bedroom. Isabella publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the red_box, but we cannot trust her statement as she may be lying. William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard, but Aiden cannot know this as he was not present during their private conversation.

Therefore, we can conclude that Aiden does not know where William thinks the cabbage is, and we cannot answer the question.
