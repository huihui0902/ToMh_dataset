16. Isabella publicly claimed that cabbage is in the red_box.
17. William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Nathan can only infer William's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thought.

Nathan was in the master_bedroom with William, so he could have inferred William's thought if they had a private or public interaction. However, we know that William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard, so Nathan would not have heard this conversation.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Nathan thinks William thinks the cabbage is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
