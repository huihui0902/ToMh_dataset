1. Logan, Nathan, Isabella, Aiden and William entered the master_bedroom.
2. William lost his gloves.
3. The cabbage is in the red_bucket.
4. Logan moved the cabbage to the green_pantry.
5. Aiden lost his gloves.
6. Logan exited the master_bedroom.
7. Nathan moved the cabbage to the red_box.
8. Nathan exited the master_bedroom.
9. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
10. Isabella exited the master_bedroom.
11. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
12. Aiden exited the master_bedroom.
13. William made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
14. William exited the master_bedroom.
15. Logan, Nathan, Isabella, Aiden and William entered the waiting_room.
16. Isabella publicly claimed that cabbage is in the red_box.
17. William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

Based on the assumption (2), we know that William can only infer where the cabbage is if he has been in the same place as the cabbage or has had a private or public interaction with someone who knows where the cabbage is. 

From the story, we know that William lost his gloves in the master_bedroom and made no movements before exiting the room. Therefore, he did not move the cabbage to the green_pantry or the red_box. 

Isabella publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the red_box, but we cannot trust her statement because of assumption (3). 

However, we know from assumption (4) that William tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself. Nathan exited the master_bedroom after William, and he moved the cabbage to the red_box. Therefore, William may believe that the cabbage is in the red_box based on Nathan's actions.

But we also know from the story that William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard. This means that William's actual thought is that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard, regardless of what he may have inferred from Nathan's actions.

Therefore, the answer is E. green_cupboard.
