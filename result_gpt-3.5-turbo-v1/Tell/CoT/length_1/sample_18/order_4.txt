1. Logan moved the cabbage to the green_pantry, so he knows where the cabbage is.
2. Aiden lost his gloves and made no movements in the master_bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Logan exited before Aiden, so he cannot infer Aiden's thought.
3. Nathan moved the cabbage to the red_box and exited after Logan. Logan can infer that Nathan thinks the cabbage is in the red_box.
4. William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard, so Logan cannot infer William's thought.
5. Isabella publicly claimed that cabbage is in the red_box, but she made no movements in the master_bedroom before exiting. Logan cannot infer Isabella's thought.
6. Based on assumption (4), Logan can trust Nathan's thought more than Isabella's thought because Nathan exited after Logan.
7. Therefore, Logan thinks Aiden thinks Nathan thinks the cabbage is in the red_box (option D).
