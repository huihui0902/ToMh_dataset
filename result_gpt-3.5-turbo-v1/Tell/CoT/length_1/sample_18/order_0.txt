1. Logan, Nathan, Isabella, Aiden and William entered the master_bedroom.
2. William lost his gloves.
3. The cabbage is in the red_bucket.
4. Logan moved the cabbage to the green_pantry.
5. Aiden lost his gloves.
6. Logan exited the master_bedroom.
7. Nathan moved the cabbage to the red_box.
8. Nathan exited the master_bedroom.
9. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
10. Isabella exited the master_bedroom.

13. William made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.

15. Logan, Nathan, Isabella, Aiden and William entered the waiting_room.
16. Isabella publicly claimed that cabbage is in the red_box.
17. William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer the following:

- Logan moved the cabbage from the red_bucket to the green_pantry, but he did not exit the master_bedroom last, so other agents may not trust his claim.
- Nathan moved the cabbage from the green_pantry to the red_box, and he exited the master_bedroom last, so other agents may trust his claim more.
- Isabella claimed that the cabbage is in the red_box, but we cannot trust her claim because she made no movements and did not witness the movement of the cabbage.
- William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard, but we cannot trust his claim because it was a private communication and we do not know if Isabella believes him.

Therefore, based on the available information, the most likely location of the cabbage is the red_box, as it was moved there by Nathan who exited the master_bedroom last and may be trusted by other agents. The correct answer is D. red_box.
