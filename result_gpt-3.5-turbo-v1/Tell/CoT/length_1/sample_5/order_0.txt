First, we know that Sophia publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate, but we cannot trust her statement because of assumption (3). 

Next, we know that Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. We can trust Logan's statement because he had a private interaction with Hannah, and he exited the garage after Sophia, so he is more trustworthy according to assumption (4). Therefore, the asparagus is in the blue_drawer, which is option L. 

The answer is L. blue_drawer.
