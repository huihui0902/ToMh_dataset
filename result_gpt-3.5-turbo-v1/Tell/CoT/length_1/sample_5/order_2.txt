First, we need to determine where the asparagus actually is. According to statement 3, the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. 

Next, we need to consider the interactions between Sophia and Logan. According to statement 16, Sophia publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate. However, according to statement 17, Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. 

Since Sophia and Logan were both in the garage together, and they had a private interaction, Logan's statement to Hannah is something that Sophia cannot infer. Therefore, we cannot determine where Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is. 

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
