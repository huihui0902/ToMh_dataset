1. Elizabeth dislikes the orange. This information is not relevant to the question.

2. Hannah, Emma, Elizabeth, Sophia and Logan entered the garage. All five agents were in the garage at the same time.

3. The asparagus is in the blue_drawer. This is a fact that is known to all agents.

4-9. Hannah, Emma, Elizabeth, Sophia, and Logan all stayed in the garage for one minute each and then exited in that order. Logan was the last to exit.

10-14. Logan saw a dog and then exited the garage. This information is not relevant to the question.

15. Hannah, Emma, Elizabeth, Sophia, and Logan entered the waiting_room. All five agents were in the waiting room at the same time.

16. Sophia publicly claimed that asparagus is in the red_crate. This claim may or may not be true.

17. Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. This is Logan's private thought.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Logan tends to lie and that private communication cannot be overheard. We also know that Logan trusts agents who exited the room later than himself. Since Logan was the last to exit the garage, he would trust the other agents who exited before him more than those who exited after him.

Therefore, we can conclude that Logan's private thought is that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer, which is also a fact known to all agents. The answer is L. blue_drawer.
