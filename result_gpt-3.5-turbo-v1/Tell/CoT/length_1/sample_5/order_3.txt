1. Elizabeth dislikes the orange. This information is not relevant to the question.

2. Hannah, Emma, Elizabeth, Sophia and Logan entered the garage. All five agents were in the garage at some point.

3. The asparagus is in the blue_drawer. This is important information for the question.

4-9. Hannah, Emma, Elizabeth, Sophia, and Logan all stayed in the garage for one minute each before exiting. This information is not relevant to the question.

10. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute. Sophia was in the garage with Elizabeth, but we don't know if they interacted.

11. Sophia exited the garage. Sophia left before Logan, so Elizabeth may trust her more than Logan.

12. Logan made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute. Logan was in the garage with Elizabeth and Sophia, but we don't know if they interacted.

13. Logan saw a dog. This information is not relevant to the question.

14. Logan exited the garage. Logan left after Sophia, so Elizabeth may trust him less than Sophia.

15. Hannah, Emma, Elizabeth, Sophia and Logan entered the waiting_room. All five agents are now in the waiting room.

16. Sophia publicly claimed that asparagus is in the red_crate. Sophia made a public claim about the location of the asparagus.

17. Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. Logan privately communicated a different location for the asparagus to Hannah.

Based on the assumptions given, Elizabeth can only infer Logan's thought about the location of the asparagus if she had a private interaction with Logan or if she trusts Hannah's information. We don't have any information about Elizabeth having a private interaction with Logan, so we need to consider Hannah's information.

Hannah was in the garage with Elizabeth, but she made no movements and stayed for only one minute. This means that Hannah may not be a trusted source of information for Elizabeth. However, we do know that Logan privately communicated with Hannah about the location of the asparagus. If Elizabeth trusts Hannah's information, she would know that Logan thinks the asparagus is in the blue_drawer.

The question asks where Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is. We know that Sophia publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate, but we don't have any information about Sophia's thoughts on Logan's opinion. Therefore, we cannot determine where Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is.

The answer is: Not enough information to determine.
