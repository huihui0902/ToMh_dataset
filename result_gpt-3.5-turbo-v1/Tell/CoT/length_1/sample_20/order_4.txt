First, we need to determine where the peach actually is. According to the story, Liam moved the peach to the blue_treasure_chest and privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle. However, we know that the characters tend to lie, so we cannot be sure which statement is true.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the peach is. Benjamin privately told Hannah that the peach is in the red_envelope, but we don't know if this is true or not. Avery was told by Liam that the peach is in the red_bottle, but again, we cannot be sure if this is true.

Now, we need to determine where Hannah thinks Benjamin thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is. Since Hannah made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, she did not witness Liam moving the peach to the blue_treasure_chest or privately telling Avery where the peach is. Therefore, she does not know where the peach is.

However, she did have a private interaction with Benjamin, who told her that the peach is in the red_envelope. We don't know if this is true or not, but we do know that Hannah believes it to be true. Therefore, Hannah thinks that Benjamin thinks the peach is in the red_envelope.

We don't know if Liam actually thinks the peach is in the red_bottle or the blue_treasure_chest, and we don't know if Avery actually knows where the peach is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Benjamin thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
