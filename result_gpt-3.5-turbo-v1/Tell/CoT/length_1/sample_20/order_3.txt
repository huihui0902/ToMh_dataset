First, we need to determine where the peach actually is. According to statement 3, the peach is in the red_basket. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the peach is. According to statement 16, Benjamin privately told Hannah that the peach is in the red_envelope. This means that Benjamin knows where the peach is. 

Now, we need to determine who Liam thinks knows where the peach is. According to statement 17, Liam privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle. However, we know that Liam tends to lie, so we cannot trust this statement. 

Since Liam lost his gloves twice, we can assume that he is not a reliable source of information. Therefore, we need to look at who Liam may have interacted with in order to determine who he may have told the location of the peach to. 

We know that Liam and Benjamin were both in the patio together, and that Benjamin stayed in the patio for one minute after Liam left. According to assumption 4, Benjamin is more likely to trust Liam since Liam exited the patio before Benjamin. Therefore, it is possible that Liam told Benjamin the location of the peach before leaving the patio. 

Since Benjamin knows where the peach is, and Liam may have told Benjamin the location of the peach, we can assume that Benjamin knows where Liam thinks the peach is. According to statement 16, Benjamin knows that Liam thinks the peach is in the red_envelope. 

However, we are looking for where Benjamin thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is. We do not have any information that suggests that Liam told Avery the location of the peach, so we cannot determine where Avery thinks the peach is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Benjamin thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is. 

The answer is: Not enough information is given to determine where Benjamin thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is.
