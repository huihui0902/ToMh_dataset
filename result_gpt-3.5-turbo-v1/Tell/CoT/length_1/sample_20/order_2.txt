First, we need to determine where the peach actually is. According to statement 3, the peach is in the red_basket. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the peach is. According to statement 16, Benjamin privately told Hannah that the peach is in the red_envelope, which is a lie based on statement 3. According to statement 17, Liam privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle, which is also a lie based on statement 3. 

Since Liam lost his gloves twice, we know that he was in the same place as Avery at least once. Therefore, Liam could have told Avery where the peach actually is. However, we cannot trust what Liam told Avery based on assumption 3. 

We also know that Liam moved the peach to the blue_treasure_chest before leaving the patio. However, we do not know if he told anyone about this. 

Based on the given options, the only one that involves Avery is N. red_bottle, which is where Liam told Avery the peach is. However, we cannot trust this information based on assumption 3. Therefore, the answer is N. red_bottle, but with the caveat that we cannot be certain that Liam actually thinks Avery thinks the peach is there.
