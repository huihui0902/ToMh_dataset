1. Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava entered the front yard.
2. The tangerine is in the red bottle.
3. Owen made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
4. Owen exited the front yard.
5. Logan moved the tangerine to the green box.
6. Logan exited the front yard.
7. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red basket.
8. Elizabeth exited the front yard.
9. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
10. Alexander exited the front yard.
11. Ava made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
12. Ava exited the front yard.
13. Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava entered the waiting room.
14. Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate.
15. Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket.

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Ava knows the true location of the tangerine because she had a private conversation with Elizabeth. We also know that Elizabeth tends to lie, so her public claim that the tangerine is in the blue crate cannot be trusted. 

Therefore, the correct answer is O. red basket.
