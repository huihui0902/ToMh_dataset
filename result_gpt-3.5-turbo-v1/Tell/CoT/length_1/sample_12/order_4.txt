1. Owen entered the front yard and made no movements before exiting. Therefore, he has no information about the location of the tangerine.
2. Logan moved the tangerine to the green box before exiting the front yard. Therefore, Logan knows that the tangerine is in the green box.
3. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red basket before exiting the front yard. Therefore, Elizabeth knows that the tangerine is in the red basket.
4. Alexander and Ava made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, they have no information about the location of the tangerine.
5. All agents entered the waiting room and Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate. However, we know that Elizabeth privately received information from Ava that the tangerine is actually in the red basket.

Based on these assumptions, we can conclude that Elizabeth knows the true location of the tangerine, but she may not trust Ava's information since Ava made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Elizabeth may not think that Ava has reliable information about the location of the tangerine.

Since Owen has no information about the location of the tangerine, Elizabeth cannot think that Owen thinks anything about the location of the tangerine.

Logan knows that the tangerine is in the green box, but we do not have any information about what Logan thinks about where Ava thinks the tangerine is.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is. The answer is not provided in the story and assumptions given.
