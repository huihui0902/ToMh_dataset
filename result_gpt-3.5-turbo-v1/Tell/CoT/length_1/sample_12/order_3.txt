1. Owen entered the front yard with Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava.
2. The tangerine was in the red bottle when they entered the front yard.
3. Owen made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
4. Owen exited the front yard.
5. Logan moved the tangerine to the green box.
6. Logan exited the front yard.
7. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red basket.
8. Elizabeth exited the front yard.
9. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
10. Alexander exited the front yard.
11. Ava made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
12. Ava exited the front yard.
13. Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava entered the waiting room.
14. Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate.
15. Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket.

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Owen only knows what happened before he exited the front yard. He does not know about Logan moving the tangerine to the green box or Elizabeth moving it to the red basket. Therefore, he cannot know where Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is.

The answer is: None of the above (as Owen cannot know).
