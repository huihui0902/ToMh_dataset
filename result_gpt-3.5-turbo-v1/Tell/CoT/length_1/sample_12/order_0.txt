First, we know that the tangerine was initially in the red_bottle, but Logan moved it to the green_box. Then, Elizabeth moved it to the red_basket. However, Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue_crate, which we know is a lie based on the assumption that every agent tends to lie. 

Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket, which means that the tangerine is actually in the red_basket. Therefore, the answer is O. red_basket.
