13. Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava entered the waiting room.
14. Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate.
15. Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Logan can infer Ava's thought only if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't affect their actual thought.

Logan moved the tangerine to the green box, so he knows that it is not in the red bottle anymore. Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate, but we know that she tends to lie, so Logan cannot trust her claim. Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket, but Logan was not present during their private interaction, so he cannot know this information.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
