13. Benjamin, Jackson, Avery, Abigail, and Mila all entered the waiting room.
14. Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue crate.
15. Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green bucket.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Mila can only infer what Benjamin thinks about the cherry's location if they had a private or public interaction. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

From the story, we know that Benjamin exited the master bedroom before Jackson, Avery, Abigail, and Mila. Therefore, Mila would tend to trust Benjamin's thoughts more than Jackson's, Avery's, or Abigail's.

Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue crate, but we don't know if Benjamin believes this to be true or not. Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green bucket, but we also don't know if Benjamin believes this to be true or not.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Mila thinks Benjamin thinks Jackson thinks the cherry is located. The answer is not provided in the given information.
