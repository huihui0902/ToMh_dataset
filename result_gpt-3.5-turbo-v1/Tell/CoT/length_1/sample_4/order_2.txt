1. Benjamin and Jackson both entered the master_bedroom and stayed there for 1 minute each.
2. Benjamin made no movements while in the master_bedroom.
3. Jackson made no movements while in the master_bedroom.
4. Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate.
5. Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket.

Based on assumption (2), we know that Benjamin can only infer Jackson's thought if they had a private or public interaction. Since there is no mention of any interaction between Benjamin and Jackson, we cannot determine where Benjamin thinks Jackson thinks the cherry is.

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information and the correct answer is "Cannot be determined".
