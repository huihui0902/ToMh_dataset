First, we need to determine where the tangerine actually is. According to Abigail's public claim, the tangerine is in the green bottle. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust this claim.

Next, we need to consider the private communication between Carter and Ava. Carter told Ava that the tangerine is in the red basket. Since Ava knows that Carter exited the cellar after Abigail, she may be more likely to trust his claim.

Now, we need to determine where Amelia thinks the tangerine is. We know that Ava made no movements in the cellar and stayed there for 1 minute, so she did not see where the tangerine was moved to. Sophia moved the tangerine to the green bottle, but she exited the cellar before Amelia entered. Therefore, Amelia did not see the tangerine in the green bottle.

Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green bottle, but we cannot trust her claim. Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red basket, but we do not know if Amelia heard this information.

Since Ava made no movements in the cellar and did not see where the tangerine was moved to, she cannot infer where Amelia thinks the tangerine is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
