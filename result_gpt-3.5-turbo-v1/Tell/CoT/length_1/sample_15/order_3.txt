First, we need to determine where the tangerine actually is. According to Abigail's public claim, the tangerine is in the green bottle. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot be sure if this claim is true.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the tangerine actually is. Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red basket, so we know that Carter knows where the tangerine is. However, we don't know if Ava believes Carter's claim or not.

Now, we need to determine where Amelia thinks the tangerine is. We don't have any information about Amelia's thoughts on the location of the tangerine.

Finally, we need to determine where Carter thinks Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is. Since we don't know where Amelia thinks the tangerine is, we cannot determine where Carter thinks Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: Insufficient information to determine the answer.
