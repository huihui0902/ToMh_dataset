First, we need to determine where the tangerine actually is. According to the story, the tangerine was moved to the red basket by Carter. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the tangerine is. Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green bottle, but we know that this is a lie. Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red basket, so we can assume that Ava knows where the tangerine is as well. 

Now, we need to determine who Abigail thinks Carter thinks Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is. Since Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green bottle, we can assume that she thinks that Amelia thinks the tangerine is in the green bottle. 

However, we don't know what Ava thinks about the location of the tangerine. Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red basket, but we don't know if Ava believes him or not. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Carter thinks Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
