14. Ava, Sophia, Amelia, Abigail, and Carter entered the waiting_room.
15. Abigail publicly claimed that tangerine is in the green_bottle.
16. Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red_basket.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can eliminate some options. We know that the tangerine was initially in the red_basket, and Carter privately told Ava that it is still in the red_basket. Therefore, we can eliminate all options except for L. red_basket.

However, we also know that Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green_bottle. We cannot trust Abigail's claim, but we also cannot completely ignore it. It is possible that Abigail is lying, but it is also possible that she moved the tangerine to the green_bottle after Carter moved it to the red_basket.

Therefore, the answer is not certain, but based on the given information, the most likely answer is L. red_basket.
