Based on the assumptions given, we know that Amelia did not have any private or public interactions with anyone who moved the tangerine. Therefore, we cannot infer her actual thought based on the actions of others. We also know that Amelia made no movements in the cellar, so we cannot infer her actual thought based on her actions. Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia really thinks the tangerine is. The answer is unknown.
