First, we need to determine where the lemon actually is. According to the story, the lemon was moved several times and ended up in the green_drawer, as Avery privately told Abigail.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the lemon is. Abigail, Avery, Liam, and Lily all moved the lemon at some point, so they know where it is. Noah did not move the lemon and did not receive any private information about its location, but he did hear Liam's private conversation with Noah about the lemon being in the blue_treasure_chest.

Now we need to determine who Noah thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is. Since Noah heard Liam's private conversation, he knows that Liam thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest. However, we don't know if Liam shared this information with Avery or Lily.

We do know that Avery moved the lemon to the blue_pantry, but we don't know if he did this before or after Liam's conversation with Noah. Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub, but we don't know if she did this before or after Avery moved it to the blue_pantry.

Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, we can assume that Noah trusts Lily more than Avery, since Lily exited the garage after Avery. Therefore, Noah may think that Lily knows where the lemon is and that Avery does not.

So, where does Noah think Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is? Since we know that Liam thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest and we don't know if he shared this information with Avery or Lily, we can't be sure what Avery or Lily think. Therefore, we can't determine where Noah thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
