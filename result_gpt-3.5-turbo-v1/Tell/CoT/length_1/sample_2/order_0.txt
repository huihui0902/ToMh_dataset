15. Abigail lost his watch.
16. Avery privately told Abigail that the lemon is in the green_drawer.
17. Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can eliminate some options. We know that Abigail moved the lemon from the blue_bathtub to the blue_treasure_chest, and Lily moved it back to the blue_bathtub. Avery moved the lemon to the blue_pantry, but privately told Abigail that it is in the green_drawer. Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest. 

We also know that the agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust their statements. Therefore, we cannot rely on Avery's statement that the lemon is in the green_drawer or Liam's statement that it is in the blue_treasure_chest. 

We also know that the agents tend to trust the agent who exited the room later than themselves. Therefore, we can assume that Abigail trusts Avery more than Liam, and Liam trusts Noah more than Abigail. 

Based on these assumptions, we can conclude that the lemon is in the blue_bathtub, as it was the last place mentioned before the agents left the garage. Therefore, the answer is A. blue_bathtub.
