Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer that Lily thinks the lemon is in the blue_bathtub. This is because Lily was the last one to move the lemon and she did not have any private or public interactions with anyone who could have told her otherwise. Additionally, since Abigail moved the lemon to the blue_treasure_chest and Avery moved it to the blue_pantry, it is likely that they were lying about the lemon's location. Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest, but since Liam is known to lie, we cannot trust his statement. Therefore, the only reliable information we have is that the lemon was initially in the blue_bathtub and Lily moved it back there before leaving the garage. The correct answer is A. blue_bathtub.
