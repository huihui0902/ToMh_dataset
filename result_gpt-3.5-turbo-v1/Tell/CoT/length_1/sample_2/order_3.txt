First, we need to determine where the lemon actually is. According to the story, the lemon was moved several times and ended up in the blue bathtub. 

Next, we need to figure out who knows where the lemon is. Avery privately told Abigail that the lemon is in the green drawer, but we know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust this information. Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue treasure chest, but we don't know if Liam is telling the truth or not. 

Now, we need to determine where Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is. Since Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue treasure chest, we can assume that Liam thinks the lemon is in the blue treasure chest. However, we don't know if Avery trusts Liam or not, so we cannot be sure if Avery thinks the lemon is in the blue treasure chest. 

Finally, we need to determine where Lily thinks the lemon is. Lily moved the lemon to the blue bathtub, so we know that she thinks the lemon is in the blue bathtub. 

Based on this information, we can conclude that Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is in the blue treasure chest, which is not the correct answer choice. Therefore, the answer to the question is not provided in the given options.
