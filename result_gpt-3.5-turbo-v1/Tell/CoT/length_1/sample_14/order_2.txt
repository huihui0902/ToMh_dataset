First, we need to determine where the tangerine actually is. According to the story, Benjamin moved the tangerine to the blue_pantry, but Elizabeth later moved it to the green_treasure_chest. Therefore, the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the tangerine is. Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box, which we know is a lie based on where the tangerine actually is. Chloe privately told Benjamin that the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest, which is true. However, we don't know if Mila knows this information.

Based on the assumption that an agent can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions, we can determine that Amelia and Mila have had a private interaction in the waiting_room. However, we don't know if Mila trusts Amelia's information or not.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
