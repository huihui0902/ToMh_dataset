First, we need to determine where the tangerine actually is. According to statement 2, the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the tangerine is. According to statement 16, Chloe privately told Benjamin that the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest. Therefore, Chloe and Benjamin know where the tangerine is.

Now, we need to determine who knows where the tangerine is based on private communication. According to statement 15, Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust this information.

Next, we need to determine where Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is. We know that Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box, but we cannot trust this information. Therefore, we need to look for other clues.

According to statement 12, Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the green_treasure_chest. Therefore, Elizabeth knows where the tangerine is. However, we need to determine where Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is.

We know that Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box, but we cannot trust this information. Therefore, we need to look for other clues.

According to assumption 2, Elizabeth can only infer Mila's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We know that Mila and Amelia were both in the attic, but we do not know if they had any interactions.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is. The answer is unknown.
