1. Owen moved the watermelon to the green_envelope and exited the sunroom.
2. Jacob moved the watermelon to the green_bucket and exited the sunroom.
3. Emma moved the watermelon to the blue_pantry and exited the sunroom.
4. William moved the watermelon to the green_basket and exited the sunroom.
5. Jacob privately told William that the watermelon is in the green_envelope.

Based on assumption (2), Owen cannot infer where Carter thinks the watermelon is because Carter did not have any interactions with Owen or any other agents who have interacted with the watermelon. Therefore, we need to find out where William thinks the watermelon is.

According to Jacob's private claim to William, the watermelon is in the green_envelope. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust Jacob's claim. 

Based on assumption (4), William tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. Since William exited the sunroom before Jacob, he may not trust Jacob's claim. Therefore, we cannot determine where William thinks the watermelon is.

Therefore, the answer to the question is: Cannot be determined.
