1. Owen moved the watermelon to the green_envelope, but we don't know if he told anyone about it.
2. Jacob moved the watermelon to the green_bucket, but he privately told William that the watermelon is in the green_envelope. So, we can assume that Jacob lied to William about the location of the watermelon.
3. Emma moved the watermelon to the blue_pantry, but she didn't tell anyone about it.
4. William moved the watermelon to the green_basket, but we don't know if he told anyone about it.
5. Carter made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute, so he doesn't have any information about the watermelon's location.
6. Emma privately told Owen that the watermelon is in the green_bucket, but we don't know if Owen trusts Emma or not.
7. Jacob dislikes the grapes, but this information is not relevant to the location of the watermelon.

Based on the above information, we can eliminate options A, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O. 

So, the answer is B. William really thinks that the watermelon is in the green_envelope, even though Jacob lied to him about it being in the green_bucket.
