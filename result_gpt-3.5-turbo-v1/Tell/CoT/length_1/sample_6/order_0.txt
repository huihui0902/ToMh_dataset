1. Owen moved the watermelon to the green_envelope, but we don't know if he told anyone about it before leaving the sunroom.
2. Jacob moved the watermelon to the green_bucket and privately told William about it. However, we don't know if William trusts Jacob or not.
3. Emma moved the watermelon to the blue_pantry, but we don't know if she told anyone about it before leaving the sunroom.
4. William moved the watermelon to the green_basket, but we don't know if he saw it in the green_bucket before moving it or not.
5. Carter made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute, so he doesn't have any information about the watermelon's location.
6. Emma privately told Owen that the watermelon is in the green_bucket, but we don't know if Owen trusts Emma or not.

Based on the given assumptions, we can eliminate some options. For example, we know that the watermelon is not in the red_drawer, red_container, red_box, blue_bathtub, green_bottle, blue_drawer, or red_bucket because none of the agents mentioned these locations.

We also know that Jacob dislikes grapes, but this information doesn't help us determine the watermelon's location.

Therefore, the most likely answer is D. green_bucket, based on Jacob's private communication with William. However, there is still some uncertainty because we don't know if William trusts Jacob or not.
