1. Aiden and Isla entered the closet first and made no movements before exiting. We don't know if they saw the tomato or not.
2. Carter moved the tomato to the blue_container, but we don't know if he saw where the tomato was originally.
3. Jack moved the tomato to the green_box, so he definitely saw where the tomato was before he moved it.
4. Evelyn moved the tomato to the red_crate, but we don't know if she saw where the tomato was originally.
5. Carter privately told Aiden that the tomato is in the green_box, but we don't know if he is telling the truth or lying.
6. Isla privately told Jack that the tomato is in the green_basket, but we don't know if she is telling the truth or lying.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Jack can only infer where the tomato is if he has been in the same place as the tomato or has had private or public interactions with someone who knows where the tomato is. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say.

From the story, we know that Jack moved the tomato to the green_box, so he definitely saw where the tomato was before he moved it. However, we don't know if he is telling the truth or lying when he tells Isla that the tomato is in the green_basket. Therefore, we cannot determine where Jack really thinks the tomato is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
