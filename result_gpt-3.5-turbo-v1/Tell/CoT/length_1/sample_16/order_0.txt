1. Aiden and Isla entered the closet first, followed by Carter, Jack, and Evelyn.
2. The tomato is initially in the red_crate.
3. Aiden and Isla made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute each, so they did not move the tomato.
4. Aiden exited the closet, so he did not move the tomato.
5. Isla exited the closet, so she did not move the tomato.
6. Carter moved the tomato to the blue_container.
7. Jack moved the tomato to the green_box.
8. Evelyn moved the tomato back to the red_crate.
9. Aiden, Isla, Carter, Jack, and Evelyn all entered the waiting_room.
10. Carter privately told Aiden that the tomato is in the green_box.
11. Isla privately told Jack that the tomato is in the green_basket.

Based on the above information, we can eliminate options A, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and O because they were not mentioned in the story. 

We know that the tomato was initially in the red_crate, then moved to the blue_container, then to the green_box, and finally back to the red_crate. However, we also know that the characters tend to lie, so we cannot trust their private communications.

We can use the exit order to determine who to trust. Aiden exited first, so we cannot trust his private conversation with Carter. Isla exited second, so we cannot trust her private conversation with Jack. Carter exited third, so we can trust his private conversation with Aiden. Jack exited fourth, so we can trust his private conversation with Isla. Evelyn exited last, so we cannot trust her.

Therefore, based on the trusted private conversations, we can conclude that the tomato is in the green_box. The answer is M.
