1. Abigail entered the laundry with Owen, Amelia, Jack, and Aiden.
2. The spinach was initially in the blue_suitcase.
3. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
4. Abigail exited the laundry.
5. Owen moved the spinach to the red_basket.
6. Owen exited the laundry.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Owen can only infer Abigail's thought if they had private or public interactions. However, there is no mention of any private or public interactions between Owen and Abigail. Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
