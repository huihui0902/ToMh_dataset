First, we need to determine where the spinach actually is. According to the story, the spinach was moved to the blue suitcase by Aiden. 

Next, we need to consider the public and private claims made by Amelia and Aiden. Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red container, which we know is false based on the actual location of the spinach. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue suitcase, which we know is true based on the actual location of the spinach.

Now, we need to consider where Owen thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is. We know that Abigail made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute before exiting. We also know that Owen moved the spinach to the red basket before exiting. However, we do not have any information about what Abigail thinks about the location of the spinach.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Aiden thinks Owen thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is. The answer is not provided in the given information.
