Based on the assumptions given, we know that Abigail can only infer the location of the spinach based on what she witnessed or what was communicated to her. We also know that Abigail tends to lie, so her public claims may not be truthful.

From the story, we know that Abigail did not move the spinach herself and only stayed in the laundry for a minute before exiting. Therefore, she did not witness the movement of the spinach to the red_basket, green_pantry, or blue_suitcase.

Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red_container, but we know that Amelia tends to lie as well. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue_suitcase, but Abigail did not witness this conversation.

Based on the information available, we cannot determine where Abigail really thinks the spinach is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
