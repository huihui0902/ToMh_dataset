1. Abigail, Owen, Amelia, Jack and Aiden entered the laundry.
2. The spinach is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
4. Abigail exited the laundry.

From the story, we know that Abigail did not move the spinach and left the laundry before anyone else. Therefore, she could not have moved the spinach to any other location. Also, we know that the spinach was initially in the blue suitcase.

5. Owen moved the spinach to the red_basket.
6. Owen exited the laundry.

Owen moved the spinach from the blue suitcase to the red basket before leaving the laundry.

7. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
8. Amelia exited the laundry.

Amelia did not move the spinach and left the laundry after Owen.

9. Jack moved the spinach to the green_pantry.
10. Abigail dislikes the lemon.
11. Jack exited the laundry.

Jack moved the spinach from the red basket to the green pantry before leaving the laundry.

12. Aiden moved the spinach to the blue_suitcase.
13. Aiden exited the laundry.

Aiden moved the spinach from the green pantry back to the blue suitcase before leaving the laundry.

14. Abigail, Owen, Amelia, Jack and Aiden entered the waiting_room.
15. Amelia publicly claimed that spinach is in the red_container.
16. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue_suitcase.

Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red container, but we know that the spinach was last seen in the blue suitcase before Aiden moved it to the green pantry and then back to the blue suitcase. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue suitcase, which is consistent with the previous movements of the spinach.

Therefore, the correct answer is F. blue_suitcase.
