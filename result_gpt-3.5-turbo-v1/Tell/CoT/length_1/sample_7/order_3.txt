First, we need to determine where Liam thinks the tomato is. According to assumption (2), Hannah can only infer Liam's thought if they have been in the same place or had private or public interactions. From the story, we know that Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer and then exited the study. Therefore, Liam thinks the tomato is in the green_drawer.

Next, we need to determine where Emma thinks the tomato is. There is no direct information about Emma's thought on the tomato's location. However, we know that Carter privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer. According to assumption (3), what a character tells others doesn't affect his actual thought. Therefore, we can infer that Emma also thinks the tomato is in the green_drawer.

Now, we can answer the question. According to assumption (2), Hannah can only infer Emma's thought if they have been in the same place or had private or public interactions. From the story, we know that Hannah and Emma were both in the study together, but there is no information about any interactions or conversations between them. Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks Emma thinks the tomato is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
