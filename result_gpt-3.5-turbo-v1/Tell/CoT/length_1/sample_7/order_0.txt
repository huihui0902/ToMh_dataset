First, we know that Emma saw a cat and made no movements before exiting the study. This information doesn't give us any clue about the location of the tomato.

Next, we know that Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer before exiting the study. This means that the tomato is either in the green_drawer or has been moved from there by someone else.

Then, Nathan publicly claimed that the tomato is in the blue_bottle, but we know that Nathan tends to lie. So, we cannot trust his claim.

Finally, Carter privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer. Since Emma and Carter have been in the same place and had a private interaction, we can infer that Carter's claim is more trustworthy than Nathan's public claim. Therefore, the tomato is most likely in the green_drawer.

The correct answer is N. green_drawer.
