First, we need to determine where Emma thinks the tomato is. According to the story, Emma made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute. She saw a cat but there is no information about her seeing the tomato. However, we know that Carter privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer. Therefore, Emma thinks the tomato is in the green_drawer.

Next, we need to determine where Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is. Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer and then exited the study. He did not have any private or public interactions with Emma, so he does not know where Emma thinks the tomato is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
