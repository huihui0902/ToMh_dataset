Based on the assumptions given, we know that Alexander can only infer the location of the green pepper from his own observations and private or public interactions with others. We also know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say to others.

From the story, we know that Alexander moved the green pepper from the blue crate to the blue suitcase before he exited the den. We also know that Hannah privately told Alexander that the green pepper is in the blue crate. Therefore, Alexander knows that the green pepper is not in the blue crate anymore, but he cannot be sure where it is.

Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green pepper is in the green envelope, but we cannot trust this information because every agent tends to lie. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Alexander thinks the green pepper is in the green envelope.

The only other information we have about the location of the green pepper is that Evelyn moved it to the blue treasure chest before she exited the den. Based on this information, we can conclude that Alexander might think the green pepper is in the blue treasure chest, since he witnessed Evelyn moving it there before she left the den.

Therefore, the answer is J. blue_treasure_chest.
