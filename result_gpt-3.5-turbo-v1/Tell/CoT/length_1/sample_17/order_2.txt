1. Alexander moved the green_pepper to the blue_suitcase before exiting the den.
2. Evelyn moved the green_pepper to the blue_treasure_chest after Alexander left the den.
3. Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate.
4. Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green_pepper is in the green_envelope.

Based on assumption (2), Evelyn can only infer Alexander's thought if they have been in the same place or had private or public interactions. Since Alexander exited the den before Evelyn entered, they did not have any interactions in the den. However, they both entered the waiting_room together, so they could have had interactions there.

Based on assumption (4), Evelyn would tend to trust Alexander's thoughts more since he exited the den after her. Therefore, we need to look for a location where the green_pepper could have been when Alexander left the den and where Evelyn could have moved it to before they entered the waiting_room.

From the story, we know that the green_pepper was initially in the blue_crate and Alexander moved it to the blue_suitcase. Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate, so we know that Alexander knew the green_pepper was not in the blue_suitcase when he left the den.

Evelyn moved the green_pepper to the blue_treasure_chest after Alexander left the den. Therefore, she must have thought that the green_pepper was not in the blue_suitcase when she entered the den. She also privately told Abigail that the green_pepper is in the green_envelope, so we know that she did not think the green_pepper was in the blue_envelope.

Therefore, the answer is J. blue_treasure_chest, since that is where Evelyn moved the green_pepper to after Alexander left the den and where she could have thought Alexander believed it to be.
