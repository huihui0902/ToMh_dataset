1. Alexander moved the green_pepper to the blue_suitcase.
2. Evelyn moved the green_pepper to the blue_treasure_chest.
3. Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate.
4. Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green_pepper is in the green_envelope.

Based on assumption (1), we know that Alexander witnessed Evelyn moving the green_pepper to the blue_treasure_chest before he exited the den. Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, D, E, H, L, N, and O.

Based on assumption (2), we know that Hannah's statement to Alexander can only be trusted if they were in the same place or had private interaction. Since Hannah privately told Alexander, we can trust her statement. Therefore, we can eliminate options C, K, and M.

Based on assumption (3), we know that Evelyn's statement to Abigail cannot be trusted. Therefore, we cannot use it to determine the location of the green_pepper.

Based on assumption (4), we know that Abigail would trust Noah's statement the most since he exited the den last. However, Noah did not make any movements or statements regarding the green_pepper. Therefore, we cannot use this assumption to determine the location of the green_pepper.

Therefore, the answer is option I, blue_suitcase, since Alexander moved the green_pepper there before Evelyn moved it to the blue_treasure_chest.
