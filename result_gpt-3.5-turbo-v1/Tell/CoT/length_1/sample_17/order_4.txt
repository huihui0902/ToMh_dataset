First, we need to determine where the green pepper actually is. According to the story, Alexander moved the green pepper from the blue crate to the blue suitcase, and then Evelyn moved it from the blue suitcase to the blue treasure chest. Therefore, the green pepper is in the blue treasure chest.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the green pepper is. Hannah privately told Alexander that the green pepper is in the blue crate, which is a lie. Abigail did not make any movements in the den and did not have any private or public interactions with anyone who knows the actual location of the green pepper. Therefore, Abigail does not know where the green pepper is.

Now, we need to determine who Abigail thinks knows where the green pepper is. Abigail did not have any private or public interactions with Evelyn, who actually moved the green pepper to the blue treasure chest. Therefore, Abigail does not think Evelyn knows where the green pepper is.

Hannah privately told Alexander that the green pepper is in the blue crate, which is a lie. Therefore, Abigail does not think Hannah knows where the green pepper is.

Noah did not make any movements in the den and did not have any private or public interactions with anyone who knows the actual location of the green pepper. Therefore, Abigail does not think Noah knows where the green pepper is.

Finally, we need to determine where Abigail thinks Hannah thinks Evelyn thinks Alexander thinks the green pepper is. Since Abigail does not think Hannah knows where the green pepper is, she cannot think about what Hannah thinks about the location of the green pepper. Therefore, the answer is none of the above (N/A).
