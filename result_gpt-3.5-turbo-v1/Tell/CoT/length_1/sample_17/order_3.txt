First, we need to determine where the green pepper actually is. According to the story, Alexander moved the green pepper from the blue crate to the blue suitcase, and then Evelyn moved it from the blue suitcase to the blue treasure chest. Therefore, the green pepper is in the blue treasure chest.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the green pepper is. Hannah privately told Alexander that the green pepper is in the blue crate, but we know that this is a lie. Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green pepper is in the green envelope, but we also know that this is a lie. Therefore, the only person who knows where the green pepper actually is, is Evelyn.

Now, we need to determine where Hannah thinks Evelyn thinks Alexander thinks the green pepper is. Since Hannah privately told Alexander that the green pepper is in the blue crate (even though it's actually in the blue treasure chest), we can assume that Hannah thinks Alexander believes the green pepper is in the blue crate. However, we know that Evelyn knows the green pepper is in the blue treasure chest, so she wouldn't think that Alexander believes it's in the blue crate. Therefore, Hannah wouldn't think that Evelyn thinks Alexander believes the green pepper is in the blue crate.

The only other option is that Hannah thinks Evelyn thinks Alexander believes the green pepper is in the green envelope, since that's what Evelyn told Abigail. Therefore, the answer is F. green_envelope.
