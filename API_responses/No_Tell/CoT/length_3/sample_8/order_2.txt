Answer: M. blue_crate

Explanation: Nathan last saw the lemon in the green_drawer (step 11). However, he entered the waiting_room with Liam (step 38), who had moved the lemon to the blue_crate (step 5). Since Nathan tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself, he would believe Liam's information about the lemon's location. Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket (step 7), but Nathan would not know this because he did not interact with Aiden after that event. Therefore, Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is in the blue_crate.
