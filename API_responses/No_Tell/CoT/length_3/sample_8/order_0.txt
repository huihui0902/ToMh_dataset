L. green_drawer

Explanation:
Following the story, we can track the movements of the lemon:
1. The lemon starts in the green_drawer (line 2).
2. Jack moves it to the blue_pantry (line 3).
3. Liam moves it to the blue_crate (line 5).
4. Aiden moves it to the green_basket (line 7).
5. Nathan moves it back to the green_drawer (line 11).

Since there are no more movements of the lemon mentioned after line 11, the lemon is really in the green_drawer.
