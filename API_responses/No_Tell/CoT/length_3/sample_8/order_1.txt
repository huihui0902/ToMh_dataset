L. green_drawer

Explanation:
Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket in step 7 and then exited the garage. However, Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer in step 11 before exiting the garage. Since Aiden trusts Nathan, who exited the room later than himself, Aiden would believe that the lemon is in the green_drawer.
