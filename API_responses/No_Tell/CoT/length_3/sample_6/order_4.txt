A. red_basket

Explanation:
Let's break down the question step by step:

1. Hannah thinks the turnip is in the blue_pantry (line 32).
2. Lily exited the study before Hannah moved the turnip, so Lily thinks the turnip is in the red_basket (line 31).
3. Noah exited the study before Lily, so he thinks Lily thinks the turnip is in the red_basket (line 29).
4. Logan exited the study before Noah, so he thinks Noah thinks Lily thinks the turnip is in the red_basket (line 21).

Therefore, Logan thinks Noah thinks Lily thinks Hannah thinks the turnip is in the red_basket.
