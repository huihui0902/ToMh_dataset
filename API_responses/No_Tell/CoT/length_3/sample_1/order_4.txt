K. blue_container

Explanation:
1. Isabella moved the lettuce to the blue_container (step 11) and then exited the back_yard (step 13).
2. Abigail entered the back_yard after Isabella exited, so she didn't see Isabella's action. However, she moved the lettuce to the red_basket (step 9) and then exited the back_yard (step 10).
3. Logan entered the back_yard after Abigail exited, so he didn't see Abigail's action. However, he moved the lettuce to the blue_treasure_chest (step 5) and then exited the back_yard (step 6).
4. Nathan entered the back_yard after Logan exited, so he didn't see Logan's action. However, he moved the lettuce to the green_cupboard (step 3) and then exited the back_yard (step 4).

Now, let's analyze their beliefs:
- Logan thinks Nathan thinks the lettuce is in the green_cupboard (step 3).
- Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container (step 2), as he didn't witness her action in step 9.
- Abigail thinks Isabella thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container (step 2), as she didn't witness her action in step 11.

So, Logan thinks Nathan thinks Abigail thinks Isabella thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container (K).
