K. blue_container

Explanation:
Isabella was the last person to move the lettuce in the back_yard (step 11). She moved it to the blue_container. Since there were no further movements of the lettuce after Isabella exited the back_yard, and she has not been in the same location with anyone who moved the lettuce after her, she would still believe the lettuce is in the blue_container.
