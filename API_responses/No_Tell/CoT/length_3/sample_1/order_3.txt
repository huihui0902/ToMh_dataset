K. blue_container

Explanation:
1. Isabella moved the lettuce to the blue_container (line 11) and then exited the back_yard (line 13).
2. Abigail entered the back_yard after Isabella exited (line 9), so she would think that Isabella thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container.
3. Nathan entered the hallway with Abigail (line 25), so he would think that Abigail thinks Isabella thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container.
