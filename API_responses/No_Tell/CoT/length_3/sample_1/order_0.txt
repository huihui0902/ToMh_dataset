K. blue_container

Explanation: The lettuce was initially in the blue_container (line 2). Nathan moved it to the green_cupboard (line 3), Logan moved it to the blue_treasure_chest (line 5), Abigail moved it to the red_basket (line 9), and finally, Isabella moved it back to the blue_container (line 11). No other movements of the lettuce were mentioned after that, so it is still in the blue_container.
