K. blue_container

Explanation: Abigail last moved the lettuce to the red_basket (step 9) and then exited the back_yard (step 10). After that, Isabella moved the lettuce to the blue_container (step 11) and exited the back_yard (step 13). Since Abigail and Isabella have not been in the same location or had any interactions after these events, Abigail would not be aware of Isabella's actions. Therefore, Abigail would think that Isabella thinks the lettuce is still in the red_basket. However, since agents tend to lie, Abigail would trust Isabella's action of moving the lettuce to the blue_container, as Isabella exited the back_yard later than Abigail. So, Abigail would think that Isabella thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container.
