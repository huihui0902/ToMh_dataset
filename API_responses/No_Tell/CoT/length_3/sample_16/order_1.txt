F. red_basket

Explanation:
When William last left the bedroom, he moved the persimmon to the red_basket (step 11). Since then, he has not been in the bedroom and has not had any interactions with Carter, who moved the persimmon to the green_basket (step 7). Therefore, William has no knowledge of the persimmon being moved after he placed it in the red_basket.
