F. red_basket

Explanation:
Hannah last saw the persimmon in the blue_crate (step 3). However, she knows that Alexander, Carter, and William were in the bedroom after her. Since Hannah trusts the person who exited the room later than herself, she would trust William's action the most. William moved the persimmon to the red_basket (step 11). Therefore, Hannah thinks William thinks the persimmon is in the red_basket.
