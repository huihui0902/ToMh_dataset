Answer: K. blue_suitcase

Explanation: 
1. Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase (step 11) and then exited the playroom (step 12).
2. William exited the playroom before Noah moved the pear (step 10), so William thinks the pear is in the green_crate (step 9).
3. Isabella entered the playroom with Noah, Jack, and Aiden (step 26), so she knows that Noah thinks the pear is in the blue_suitcase (step 11).
4. Since Isabella knows that William exited the playroom before Noah, she can infer that William thinks Noah thinks the pear is in the blue_suitcase (step 11).
