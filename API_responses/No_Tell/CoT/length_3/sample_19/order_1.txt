L. blue_crate

Explanation:
Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase (step 11) and then exited the playroom (step 12). After that, Aiden moved the pear to the blue_crate (step 14) and exited the playroom (step 15). Since Noah trusts Aiden, who exited the room later than himself, Noah would believe that the pear is in the blue_crate.
