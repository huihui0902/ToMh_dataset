C. blue_bucket

Explanation: Aiden was the one who moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket in step 9. Since Jacob exited the master_bedroom in step 4, before Aiden moved the sweet_potato, Aiden would think that Jacob still believes the sweet_potato is in its original location, which is the green_bottle. However, since agents tend to lie, Aiden would think that Jacob would not tell the truth about the sweet_potato's location. Therefore, Aiden would think that Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket, as it is the location Aiden moved it to.
