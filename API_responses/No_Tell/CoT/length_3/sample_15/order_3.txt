C. blue_bucket

Explanation:
1. Jacob saw the sweet_potato in the green_bottle (line 2) and left the master_bedroom (line 4).
2. Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket (line 9) and left the master_bedroom (line 10).
3. Jacob didn't see Aiden's action, so he still thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle.
4. Mila saw Aiden's action (line 9) and knows that Aiden thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket.
5. Therefore, Mila thinks Aiden thinks Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket.
