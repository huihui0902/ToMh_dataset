Explanation: 
1. Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle (line 2).
2. Aiden moves the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket (line 9) and exits the master_bedroom. Jacob didn't witness this, so he still thinks it's in the green_bottle.
3. Amelia moves the sweet_potato back to the green_bottle (line 11) and exits the master_bedroom. Aiden didn't witness this, so he still thinks it's in the blue_bucket.
4. Elizabeth entered the master_bedroom with Aiden and exited after him (lines 7 and 10). She didn't witness any sweet_potato movements, but she knows Aiden exited after Jacob. So, she thinks Aiden thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket.
5. Mila entered the master_bedroom with Elizabeth and exited after her (lines 6 and 8). She didn't witness any sweet_potato movements, but she knows Elizabeth exited after Aiden. So, she thinks Elizabeth thinks Aiden thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket.
6. Finally, Elizabeth entered the waiting_room with Mila (line 13). She knows Mila exited the master_bedroom after her, so she thinks Mila thinks Aiden thinks Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket.
