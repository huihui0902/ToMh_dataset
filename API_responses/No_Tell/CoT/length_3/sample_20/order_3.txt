Answer: L. green_drawer

Explanation: 
1. Evelyn thinks the spinach is in the red_container (line 7).
2. Jackson exited the living_room after Evelyn (line 4 and 9), so he knows Evelyn moved the spinach to the red_container.
3. Liam exited the living_room after Jackson (line 11), so he knows Jackson saw Evelyn move the spinach to the red_container.
4. Noah moved the spinach to the green_drawer (line 12), but Liam doesn't know this because he exited the living_room before Noah.
5. Therefore, Liam thinks Jackson thinks Evelyn thinks the spinach is in the green_drawer.
