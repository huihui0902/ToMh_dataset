Answer: N. red_drawer

Explanation: 
1. Owen moved the onion to the red_drawer (step 7) and exited the attic (step 8).
2. Nathan entered the attic after Owen (step 9) and made no movements, so he would think the onion is in the red_drawer.
3. Emily was not in the attic when Nathan was there, so she wouldn't know Nathan's thoughts. However, Emily, Charlotte, Owen, Nathan, and Liam entered the waiting_room together (step 14), so Owen would assume that Emily knows Nathan's thoughts based on their interaction in the waiting_room.
4. Therefore, Owen thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks the onion is in the red_drawer.
