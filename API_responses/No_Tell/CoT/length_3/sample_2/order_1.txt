N. red_drawer

Explanation:
Nathan was in the attic when Owen moved the onion to the red_drawer (step 7). Nathan made no movements during his time in the attic (step 9), so he did not move the onion himself. He exited the attic after Owen (step 10), so he would trust Owen's action of placing the onion in the red_drawer. When Nathan re-entered the attic later (step 27), he made no movements again (step 36) and exited after Owen had moved the onion to the blue_bottle (step 31). However, Nathan would not trust Owen's later action since he exited the attic before Owen this time. Therefore, Nathan really thinks the onion is in the red_drawer.
