Answer: N. red_drawer

Explanation: Emily last saw the onion in the red_drawer when Owen moved it there (step 7). After that, Emily did not enter the attic again and had no interactions with Nathan. Therefore, Emily would think that Nathan thinks the onion is still in the red_drawer, as she has no information about any further movements of the onion.
