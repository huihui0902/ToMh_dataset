F. blue_bathtub

Explanation:
1. Isla thinks the cabbage is in the blue_bathtub (line 31).
2. Elizabeth exited the playroom before Isla moved the cabbage to the blue_bathtub (line 7), so she thinks Isla thinks the cabbage is in the blue_bottle (line 10).
3. Abigail exited the playroom before Elizabeth re-entered (line 14), so she thinks Elizabeth thinks Isla thinks the cabbage is in the blue_treasure_chest (line 8).
4. Aiden exited the playroom after Abigail (line 34), so he thinks Abigail thinks Elizabeth thinks Isla thinks the cabbage is in the blue_bathtub (line 31).
