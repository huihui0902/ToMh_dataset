M. green_cupboard

Explanation:
1. When William exited the pantry the first time, the corn was in the red_envelope (step 8).
2. When Emily exited the pantry, the corn was in the red_envelope (step 8).
3. When Isla exited the pantry, the corn was in the green_bottle (step 12).
4. When Emma exited the pantry, the corn was in the green_bathtub (step 14).

Now, let's analyze the second visit to the pantry:
5. When William exited the pantry the second time, the corn was still in the green_bathtub (step 29).
6. When Isla exited the pantry, the corn was in the green_cupboard (step 31).
7. When Emily exited the pantry, the corn was in the blue_crate (step 34).
8. When Emma exited the pantry, the corn was in the green_bottle (step 36).

Emma thinks Emily thinks William thinks the corn is in the green_cupboard because when William exited the pantry the second time, the corn was in the green_bathtub (step 29), and Isla moved it to the green_cupboard (step 30) before Emily exited the pantry (step 34). Since agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later than themselves, Emily would trust Isla's action, and thus, Emma would think that Emily thinks William thinks the corn is in the green_cupboard.
