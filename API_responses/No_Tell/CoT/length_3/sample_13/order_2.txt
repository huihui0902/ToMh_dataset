M. green_cupboard

Explanation:
When Emily entered the pantry (step 26), the corn was in the green_bathtub (step 27). However, she did not witness Jackson moving the corn there (step 13). The last time Emily saw someone move the corn was when she moved it to the red_envelope (step 7). After that, she exited the pantry (step 8) and did not witness any other movements of the corn.

When William entered the pantry (step 26), he did not make any movements (step 28) and exited the pantry (step 29). Since William did not witness any movements of the corn, Emily would think that William still believes the corn is in the location where he last moved it, which is the green_cupboard (step 3).
