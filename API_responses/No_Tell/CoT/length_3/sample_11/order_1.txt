A. green_bathtub

Explanation: William exited the porch after step 4, so he did not witness any of the melon movements that happened after that. The last thing he saw was the melon in the green_bathtub (step 2). Since he has not had any interactions with the other agents to infer their mental states or receive any new information, he still believes the melon is in the green_bathtub.
