A. green_bathtub

Explanation: The melon's location changes several times throughout the story. Initially, it is in the green_bathtub (line 2). Aiden moves it to the blue_pantry (line 7), Emma moves it to the green_bucket (line 10), and finally, Isla moves it back to the green_bathtub (line 12). No further movements of the melon are mentioned, so it remains in the green_bathtub.
