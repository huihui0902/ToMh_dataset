L. blue_crate

Explanation:
Elizabeth moved the lime to the green_pantry (step 4) and then exited the cellar (step 5). After she left, the lime was moved multiple times by other agents: Nathan moved it to the green_basket (step 9), Owen moved it to the red_box (step 11), and finally, Jackson moved it to the blue_crate (step 13). Since Elizabeth was not present during these movements, she has no knowledge of them. However, according to rule (3), agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later than themselves. Elizabeth would trust Jackson's movement the most, as he was the last to exit the cellar. Therefore, Elizabeth would believe the lime is in the blue_crate.
