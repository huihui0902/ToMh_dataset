Answer: L. blue_crate

Explanation: 
1. Elizabeth moved the lime to the green_pantry (step 4) and then exited the cellar (step 5).
2. Nathan moved the lime to the green_basket (step 9) and then exited the cellar (step 10).
3. Owen moved the lime to the red_box (step 11) and then exited the cellar (step 12).
4. Jackson moved the lime to the blue_crate (step 13) and then exited the cellar (step 14).

Since Owen exited the cellar before Jackson, he is not aware of Jackson's action. Owen thinks the lime is in the red_box. Alexander exited the cellar before Owen, so he is not aware of Owen's action. Alexander thinks the lime is in the green_basket. Elizabeth exited the cellar before Nathan, so she is not aware of Nathan's action. Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry.

Now, Owen and Alexander entered the workshop together (step 25). Since they are in the same location, Owen can infer Alexander's mental state. Owen thinks Alexander thinks the lime is in the green_basket. However, Alexander exited the workshop before Elizabeth (step 34), so he is not aware of her mental state. Therefore, Owen thinks Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the location where she last saw it, which is the blue_crate.
