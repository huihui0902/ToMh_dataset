M. green_basket

Explanation:
1. Elizabeth moved the lime to the green_pantry (step 4) and then exited the cellar (step 5).
2. Alexander stayed in the cellar and saw Nathan move the lime to the green_basket (step 9) before exiting the cellar (step 8).
3. Alexander has not been in the same location as Elizabeth since she exited the cellar, so he has no reason to believe her knowledge has changed.
4. Therefore, Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_basket (M).
