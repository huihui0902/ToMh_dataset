A. blue_suitcase

Explanation: In step 7, Jack moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest. However, in step 11, Benjamin moved the beans back to the blue_suitcase. Since Owen, Jack, and Jackson were not in the hall when Benjamin moved the beans back to the blue_suitcase, they are not aware of this change. Therefore, Owen thinks that Jack still believes the beans are in the green_treasure_chest. However, in step 24, it is publicly stated that the beans are in the blue_suitcase. Since public claims are heard by everyone, Jack would have heard this information. Based on rule 3, agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later than themselves, and Benjamin exited the hall later than Jack. Therefore, Owen would think that Jack now believes the beans are in the blue_suitcase.
