A. blue_suitcase

Explanation: In the story, the beans were initially in the blue_suitcase (line 2). Jack moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest (line 7), but then Benjamin moved them back to the blue_suitcase (line 11). No other movements of the beans were mentioned, so the beans are really in the blue_suitcase.
