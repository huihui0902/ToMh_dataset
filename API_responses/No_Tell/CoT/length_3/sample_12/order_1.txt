E. green_treasure_chest

Explanation: Jack moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest in step 7 and then exited the hall. Since no other agent interacted with Jack before he moved the beans, and he did not witness any other changes to the beans' location, Jack really thinks the beans are in the green_treasure_chest.
