A. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
Step 1: Jack moves the beans to the green_treasure_chest (line 7).
Step 2: Benjamin moves the beans back to the blue_suitcase (line 11).
Step 3: Liam exits the hall before Jack moves the beans (line 6), so Liam thinks the beans are in the blue_suitcase.
Step 4: Owen exits the hall before Jack moves the beans (line 4), so Owen thinks the beans are in the blue_suitcase.
Step 5: Since Liam thinks Owen thinks the beans are in the blue_suitcase, Liam would also think that Owen thinks Jack thinks the beans are in the blue_suitcase.
