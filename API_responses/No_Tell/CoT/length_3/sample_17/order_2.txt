Answer: G. green_pantry

Explanation: Jackson was last in the garage during step 11, before any of the subsequent movements of the eggplant took place. When Emma entered the garage in step 14, Jackson was not there to witness her actions. However, Jackson knows that Emma was in the garage after him, so he would trust her knowledge of the eggplant's location. Since Emma moved the eggplant to the green_box in step 7, and then Emily moved it to the green_bottle in step 18, and finally Jack moved it to the green_pantry in step 20, Jackson would trust that Emma thinks the eggplant is in the green_pantry, as she would have witnessed Jack's action before exiting the garage.
