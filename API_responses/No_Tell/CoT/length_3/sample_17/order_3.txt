2. Jackson has not re-entered the garage since then, so he still thinks the eggplant is in the green_box.
3. Jack was in the garage with Jackson (step 11), so he knows that Jackson thinks the eggplant is in the green_box.
4. Therefore, Jack thinks Jackson thinks Emma thinks the eggplant is in the green_box.
