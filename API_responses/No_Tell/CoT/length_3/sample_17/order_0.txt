G. green_pantry

Explanation:
Initially, the eggplant is in the green_pantry (line 2). Emily moves it to the blue_drawer (line 3). Emma moves it to the green_box (line 7). Emily moves it to the green_bottle (line 18). Finally, Jack moves it to the green_pantry (line 20). No further movements of the eggplant are mentioned, so it remains in the green_pantry.
