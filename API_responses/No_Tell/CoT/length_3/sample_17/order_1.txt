Answer: H. green_box

Explanation: Emma last moved the eggplant to the green_box in step 7 and exited the garage. She re-entered the garage in step 14, but she made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute in step 16. She exited the garage again in step 17. Since Emma did not witness any other movements of the eggplant after she placed it in the green_box, she would still believe that the eggplant is in the green_box.
