E. blue_cupboard

Explanation: Isla entered the staircase after Carter moved the peas to the green_bucket (step 6) and before Amelia moved the peas to the blue_cupboard (step 10). Since Isla didn't make any movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute (step 7), she didn't witness Amelia's action. However, Isla entered the waiting_room with Amelia (step 24), so she can infer Amelia's mental state. Amelia exited the staircase after moving the peas to the blue_cupboard (step 11), so Isla would trust Amelia's knowledge and believe that the peas are in the blue_cupboard.
