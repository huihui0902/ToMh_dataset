E. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
Step 1: Amelia moved the peas to the blue_cupboard (step 10) before exiting the staircase.
Step 2: Carter exited the staircase after Amelia (step 6), so he knows that Amelia moved the peas to the blue_cupboard.
Step 3: Isla exited the staircase after Carter (step 8), so Carter thinks Amelia believes Isla knows the peas are in the blue_cupboard.
Step 4: Since there are no further movements or interactions regarding the peas, Carter thinks Amelia thinks Isla thinks the peas are in the blue_cupboard.
