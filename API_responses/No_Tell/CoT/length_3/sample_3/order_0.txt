E. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
Initially, the peas are in the green_treasure_chest (2). Mila moves the peas to the blue_bucket (3) and exits the staircase. Carter then moves the peas to the green_bucket (5) and exits the staircase. Amelia moves the peas to the blue_cupboard (10) and exits the staircase. No other movements of the peas are mentioned in the story. Therefore, the peas are really in the blue_cupboard.
