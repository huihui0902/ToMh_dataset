Answer: E. blue_cupboard

Explanation: Amelia moved the peas to the blue_cupboard in step 10 and then exited the staircase. Isla entered the staircase after Amelia in step 15 but made no movements. Since Isla did not move the peas and witnessed Amelia's action, Amelia would think that Isla thinks the peas are in the blue_cupboard.
