L. green_cupboard

Evelyn would think the watermelon is in the green_cupboard because that is where Mila moved it to in step 13. Evelyn was still in the staircase at that time and witnessed the movement. Although Logan moved the watermelon to the red_bottle in step 31, Evelyn had already exited the staircase and did not witness this change.
