M. red_bottle

Explanation: The watermelon was initially in the green_cupboard (line 3). Mila moved the watermelon to the green_cupboard again (line 13), which means it was already there. Later, Logan moved the watermelon to the red_bottle (line 31). Since Logan was the last person to move the watermelon and all agents tend to trust agents who exited the room later than themselves, the watermelon is really in the red_bottle.
