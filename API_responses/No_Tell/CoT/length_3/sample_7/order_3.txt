Answer: L. green_cupboard

Explanation: 
Step 1: Mila moves the watermelon to the green_cupboard (line 13).
Step 2: Chloe, Charlotte, and Logan enter the staircase (line 16). They don't know about the watermelon's new location.
Step 3: Chloe moves the lemon to the green_cupboard (line 22). He now knows the watermelon is in the green_cupboard.
Step 4: Evelyn, Mila, Logan, and Chloe enter the staircase (line 25). The watermelon is still in the green_cupboard (line 26).
Step 5: Logan moves the watermelon to the red_bottle (line 31). Chloe doesn't know about this change.

Chloe thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the green_cupboard because that's where it was when they were all last in the staircase together (line 25). Chloe doesn't know that Logan moved the watermelon to the red_bottle (line 31) because he exited the staircase before Logan (line 34).
