M. red_pantry

Explanation:
The story mentions the following movements of the cucumber:
1. In the blue_drawer (line 2)
2. Moved to the blue_container by Abigail (line 3)
3. Moved to the blue_bathtub by Hannah (line 8)
4. Moved to the red_pantry by Owen (line 11)

No other movements of the cucumber are mentioned after it was moved to the red_pantry. Therefore, the cucumber is really in the red_pantry.
