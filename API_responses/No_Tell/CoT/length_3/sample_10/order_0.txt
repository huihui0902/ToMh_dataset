F. red_container

Explanation: 
1. Initially, the sweet_potato is in the red_container (line 2).
2. Ava moves the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard (line 6).
3. Charlotte moves the sweet_potato to the green_drawer (line 10).
4. William moves the sweet_potato back to the red_container (line 12).

Since there are no more movements of the sweet_potato mentioned in the story, it remains in the red_container.
