F. red_container

Explanation:
1. Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_container because:
2. Charlotte last saw the sweet_potato in the green_drawer (step 10).
3. Charlotte knows that William moved the sweet_potato to the red_container after she left (step 12).
4. Charlotte knows that Logan, Ava, and Evelyn were not in the kitchen when William moved the sweet_potato (step 13).
5. Therefore, Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is still in the green_drawer (step 10).
6. However, since every agent tends to lie, Charlotte would assume that Logan would not tell the truth about the sweet_potato's location.
7. Since Charlotte knows that the sweet_potato was moved to the red_container (step 12), she would think that Logan would lie and say it is in the red_container, which is where she thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is.
