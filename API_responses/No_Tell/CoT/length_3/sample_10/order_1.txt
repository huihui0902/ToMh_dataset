G. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
Evelyn entered the kitchen after Ava moved the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard (step 6) and before Charlotte moved it to the green_drawer (step 10). Since Evelyn stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute without making any movements (step 8), she witnessed Ava's action of moving the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard. Therefore, Evelyn really thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_cupboard.
