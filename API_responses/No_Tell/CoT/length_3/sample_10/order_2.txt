G. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
When Logan left the kitchen (step 5), the sweet_potato was in the blue_cupboard (step 6). Evelyn entered the kitchen after Logan and made no movements (step 8), so she would have seen the sweet_potato in the blue_cupboard. Since Logan and Evelyn were in the same location (the waiting_room) after they both exited the kitchen, Logan can infer that Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_cupboard.
