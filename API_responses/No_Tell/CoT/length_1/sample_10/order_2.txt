Answer: I. green_bucket

Explanation: When Nathan exited the pantry, the plum was still in the red_pantry (step 6). However, Evelyn moved the plum to the green_bucket after Nathan left (step 7). Since William entered the pantry after Nathan and stayed there for 1 minute (step 9), he would have witnessed Evelyn moving the plum to the green_bucket. Therefore, Nathan would think that William thinks the plum is in the green_bucket.
