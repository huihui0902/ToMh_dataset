G. red_pantry

Explanation: The plum's location changes twice in the story. First, Evelyn moves it from the red_pantry to the green_bucket (step 7). Then, Jacob moves it back to the red_pantry (step 14). Since there are no more changes to the plum's location after step 14, the plum is really in the red_pantry.
