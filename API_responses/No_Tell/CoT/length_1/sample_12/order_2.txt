Answer: F. green_basket

Explanation: Mila exited the garden after step 4, so she knows the melon was in the green_box. Ava moved the melon to the green_basket in step 5 and then exited the garden. Since William entered the garden after Ava exited, Mila would assume that William saw the melon in the green_basket, as he would trust Ava's action since she exited the room later than Mila.
