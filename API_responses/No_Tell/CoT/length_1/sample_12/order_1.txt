Answer: G. green_box

Explanation: William made no movements and stayed in the garden for 1 minute. He exited the garden before the melon was moved by Ava and Ella. Therefore, he did not witness the melon being moved to the green_basket or the red_bottle. Since the melon was initially in the green_box, William would believe that the melon is still in the green_box.
