I. red_bottle

Explanation: The melon's location changed twice in the story. Initially, it was in the green_box (line 2). Then, Ava moved it to the green_basket (line 5). Finally, Ella moved it to the red_bottle (line 9). Since there were no other movements mentioned regarding the melon, it is currently in the red_bottle.
