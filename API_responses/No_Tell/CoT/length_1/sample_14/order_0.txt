K. green_envelope

Explanation: The lime's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the green_envelope (2). Emily moved it to the blue_pantry (3), and then Jack moved it to the blue_suitcase (5). Finally, Abigail moved the lime back to the green_envelope (13). Since no other movements were made after Abigail's action, the lime is really in the green_envelope.
