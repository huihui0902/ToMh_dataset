M. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
1. Jack moved the lime to the blue_suitcase and then exited the playroom (step 5 and 6).
2. Avery entered the playroom after Jack, but Avery made no movements (step 7 and 8). So, Jack would think that Avery believes the lime is still in the blue_suitcase.
3. Abigail moved the lime to the green_envelope after Avery exited the playroom (step 13). Since Avery exited before Abigail, Avery would not know about this change.
4. Therefore, Jack thinks Avery thinks Abigail thinks the lime is in the blue_suitcase.
