M. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
1. Aiden exited the playroom after Jack, so Aiden knows that Jack moved the lime to the blue_suitcase.
2. Aiden also knows that Avery was in the playroom before him and saw Jack move the lime to the blue_suitcase.
3. Since Aiden and Avery have been in the same location, Aiden can infer that Avery knows the lime is in the blue_suitcase.
4. Abigail entered the playroom after Avery exited, so Avery would not know that Abigail moved the lime to the green_envelope.
5. Therefore, Aiden thinks Jack thinks Avery thinks Abigail thinks the lime is in the blue_suitcase.
