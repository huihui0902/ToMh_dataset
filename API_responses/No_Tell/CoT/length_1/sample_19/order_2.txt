Answer: L. green_bottle

Explanation: According to the story, the asparagus is in the green_bottle (line 2). All five characters entered the staircase and made no movements, staying for 1 minute each (lines 1-12). They all exited the staircase and entered the waiting_room (line 13). Since they all witnessed the same information and there were no interactions or communications between them, Hannah would think that Emily also knows the asparagus is in the green_bottle.
