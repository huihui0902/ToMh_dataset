Answer: H. green_basket

Explanation: Ella moved the spinach to the green_basket in step 3 and then exited the attic. Emma entered the attic after Ella, but she made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute before exiting. Since Ella and Emma have been in the same location (the attic), Ella can infer Emma's mental state. Since Emma did not witness any further movements of the spinach, Ella would think that Emma thinks the spinach is still in the green_basket.
