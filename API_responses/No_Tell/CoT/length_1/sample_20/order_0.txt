A. blue_bathtub

Explanation: The watermelon's location changed multiple times throughout the story. It started in the blue_cupboard (2), then moved to the red_box by Mila (3), the green_bottle by Ava (5), and finally to the blue_bathtub by Emily (7). Since no other movements were made after Emily moved the watermelon to the blue_bathtub, that is its final location.
