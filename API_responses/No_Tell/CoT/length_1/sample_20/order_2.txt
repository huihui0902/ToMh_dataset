D. green_bottle

Explanation: 
1. Jacob entered the front_yard after Ava had already exited, so he knows that Ava moved the watermelon to the green_bottle (step 5).
2. Since Jacob did not witness any further movements of the watermelon, he would believe that Ava thinks the watermelon is still in the green_bottle.
