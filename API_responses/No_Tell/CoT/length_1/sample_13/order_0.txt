F. blue_crate

Explanation: The cabbage's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the red_container (line 2). Amelia moved it to the green_envelope (line 3), Abigail moved it to the green_crate (line 5), and finally, Charlotte moved it to the blue_crate (line 7). Since Carter and Nathan made no movements, the cabbage's last known location is the blue_crate.
