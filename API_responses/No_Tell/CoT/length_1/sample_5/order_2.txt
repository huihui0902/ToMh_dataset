L. green_envelope

Explanation:
When Logan exited the patio, the potato was still in the green_envelope (step 5). Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle after Logan left (step 6), but Logan did not witness this. Benjamin entered the patio after Logan had already exited, so he did not have any interaction with Logan and cannot infer Logan's mental state. Therefore, Benjamin would think that Logan still believes the potato is in the green_envelope.
