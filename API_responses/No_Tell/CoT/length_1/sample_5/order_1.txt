Answer: L. green_envelope

Explanation: Logan was the first to exit the patio, and he witnessed the potato being in the green_envelope (line 2). Since he made no movements and exited before Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle (line 6), he would still believe the potato is in the green_envelope.
