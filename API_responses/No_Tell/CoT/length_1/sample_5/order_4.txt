Answer: L. green_envelope

Explanation:
1. Logan exits the patio first and only knows the potato is in the green_envelope.
2. Charlotte moves the potato to the red_bottle and exits the patio.
3. Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn make no movements and exit the patio in that order.

Since Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn did not witness Charlotte moving the potato, they all believe the potato is still in the green_envelope. Hannah thinks Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks Logan thinks the potato is in the green_envelope because none of them witnessed the potato being moved, and they all trust Logan's knowledge since he exited the patio first.
