L. green_envelope

Explanation:
1. Logan entered the patio and saw the potato in the green_envelope. He made no movements and exited the patio.
2. Charlotte entered the patio, saw the potato in the green_envelope, and moved it to the red_bottle. She then exited the patio.
3. Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the patio and made no movements. They did not see the potato being moved by Charlotte.

Since Charlotte knows that Logan saw the potato in the green_envelope before she moved it, she would think that Benjamin thinks Logan thinks the potato is in the green_envelope.
