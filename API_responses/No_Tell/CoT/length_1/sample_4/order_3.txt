K. green_bucket

Emily thinks Mila thinks Noah thinks the spinach is in the green_bucket because all of them were in the front_yard together and witnessed the spinach being in the green_bucket. They all exited the front_yard and entered the waiting_room, so they have been in the same location and can infer each other's mental state. Since they all tend to lie, they would trust the agent who exited the room later than themselves, but in this case, all of them witnessed the same event, so they would all believe the spinach is in the green_bucket.
