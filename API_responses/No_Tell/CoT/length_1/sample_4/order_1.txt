K. green_bucket

Explanation: Noah was in the front_yard when the spinach was placed in the green_bucket by Mila (lines 3 and 13). Since Noah didn't have any interactions with other agents regarding the spinach's location and witnessed the spinach being placed in the green_bucket, he would believe that the spinach is in the green_bucket.
