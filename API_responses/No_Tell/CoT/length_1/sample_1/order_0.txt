K. green_drawer

Explanation:
1. Avery moved the lettuce to the green_bathtub (line 3).
2. Charlotte moved the lettuce to the blue_pantry (line 6).
3. Owen moved the lettuce to the green_drawer (line 14).

Since Owen was the last person to move the lettuce and exited the living_room last, the other agents would trust his action. Therefore, the lettuce is really in the green_drawer.
