Answer: L. blue_pantry

Explanation: 
1. Avery moved the lettuce to the green_bathtub and then exited the living_room.
2. Charlotte moved the lettuce to the blue_pantry and then exited the living_room.
3. Owen entered the living_room after Charlotte, so he knows that Charlotte moved the lettuce to the blue_pantry.
4. Since Charlotte was in the living_room when Avery moved the lettuce to the green_bathtub, she thinks Avery believes the lettuce is in the green_bathtub.
5. However, Owen knows that Charlotte moved the lettuce to the blue_pantry after Avery left, so he thinks Charlotte believes Avery thinks the lettuce is in the green_bathtub, but he knows the actual location is the blue_pantry.
