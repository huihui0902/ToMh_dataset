Answer: H. blue_cupboard

Explanation: 
1. Jack moved the eggplant to the green_bathtub and then exited the pantry.
2. Hannah moved the eggplant to the blue_cupboard and then exited the pantry.
3. Owen moved the eggplant to the green_basket and then exited the pantry.
4. Noah moved the eggplant to the green_envelope and then exited the pantry.

Since Jack exited the pantry before Hannah, he is not aware of the movements made by Hannah, Owen, and Noah. Therefore, Jack thinks that Hannah saw him move the eggplant to the green_bathtub. However, Hannah moved the eggplant to the blue_cupboard after Jack left, so she would think that Noah saw her move it there. Thus, Jack thinks that Hannah thinks Noah thinks the eggplant is in the blue_cupboard.
