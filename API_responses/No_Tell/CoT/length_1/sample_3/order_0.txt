Answer: F. green_envelope

Explanation: The eggplant's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Here is the sequence of events:

1. The eggplant starts in the green_envelope (line 2).
2. Jack moves it to the green_bathtub (line 6).
3. Hannah moves it to the blue_cupboard (line 8).
4. Owen moves it to the green_basket (line 10).
5. Noah moves it back to the green_envelope (line 12).

Since there are no more movements mentioned after line 12, the eggplant is really in the green_envelope.
