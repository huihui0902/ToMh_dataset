Answer: J. green_basket

Explanation: Hannah moved the eggplant to the blue_cupboard (step 8) and then exited the pantry (step 9). Owen moved the eggplant to the green_basket (step 10) and exited the pantry (step 11). Since Hannah exited the pantry before Owen, she would trust Owen's knowledge of the eggplant's location. Therefore, Hannah thinks Noah thinks the eggplant is in the green_basket.
