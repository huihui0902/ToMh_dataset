F. green_envelope

Explanation: Noah was the last person to move the eggplant, and he moved it to the green_envelope (step 12). Since he was the last one to exit the pantry, he has no reason to believe that the eggplant was moved again. Therefore, Noah really thinks the eggplant is in the green_envelope.
