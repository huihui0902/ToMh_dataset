F. blue_crate

Liam thinks the lettuce is in the blue_crate because he exited the patio before Alexander moved the lettuce to the blue_container. Since Liam made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, he witnessed the lettuce being in the blue_crate. There were no interactions between Liam and Alexander that would change Liam's belief about the location of the lettuce.
