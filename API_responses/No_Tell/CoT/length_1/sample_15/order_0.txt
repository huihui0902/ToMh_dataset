L. blue_container

Explanation: In the story, the watermelon is initially in the blue_container (line 2). Ella moves it to the red_pantry (line 7), but then Amelia moves it back to the blue_container (line 11). Since there are no other movements of the watermelon mentioned, it is still in the blue_container.
