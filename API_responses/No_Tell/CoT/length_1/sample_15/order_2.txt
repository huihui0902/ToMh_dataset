L. blue_container

Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container because when Avery exited the backyard, the watermelon was still in the blue_container. Owen is not aware of the watermelon being moved to the red_pantry by Ella or back to the blue_container by Amelia, as he exited the backyard before those events occurred.
