L. blue_container

Explanation:
1. Avery exits the back_yard before any movements are made with the watermelon, so Avery thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.
2. Owen also exits the back_yard before any movements are made with the watermelon, so Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.
3. Ella moves the watermelon to the red_pantry, but since she knows Owen exited before her, she knows Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.
4. Amelia moves the watermelon back to the blue_container, and since she exited last, she knows Ella thinks Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.
