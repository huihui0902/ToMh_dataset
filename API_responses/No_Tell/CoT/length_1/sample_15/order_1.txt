L. blue_container

Avery exited the backyard after staying there for 1 minute without making any movements (lines 3-4). At that time, the watermelon was still in the blue_container (line 2). Avery did not witness any other movements or interactions related to the watermelon, so Avery would still believe the watermelon is in the blue_container.
