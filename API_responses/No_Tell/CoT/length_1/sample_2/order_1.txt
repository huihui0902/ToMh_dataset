Answer: D. green_box

Explanation: Jacob entered the bedroom with Isabella, Carter, Elizabeth, and Hannah. He witnessed Isabella moving the tomato to the green_box (step 3) and then exiting the bedroom (step 4). Carter and Hannah made no movements, so they didn't change the location of the tomato. Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container (step 7) and then exited the bedroom (step 8). However, since Jacob tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself, he would trust Elizabeth's action and believe the tomato is in the green_box.
