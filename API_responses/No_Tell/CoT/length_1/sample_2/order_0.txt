E. blue_container

Explanation: The tomato's location changes throughout the story. Initially, it is in the green_bottle (line 2). Isabella moves it to the green_box (line 3). Finally, Elizabeth moves it to the blue_container (line 7). Since no other movements are mentioned after this, the tomato is really in the blue_container.
