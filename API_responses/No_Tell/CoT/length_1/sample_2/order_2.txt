D. green_box

Explanation:
Hannah entered the bedroom after Elizabeth exited, so she didn't witness Elizabeth moving the tomato to the blue_container. Hannah saw that the tomato was in the green_box when she was in the bedroom. Since Jacob entered the bedroom after Hannah and made no movements, Hannah would think that Jacob also saw the tomato in the green_box.
