2. Hannah entered the bedroom after Isabella exited, so Isabella has no information about Hannah's knowledge (Step 9 and 11). Therefore, Isabella thinks Hannah thinks the tomato is in the green_box.
3. Jacob entered the bedroom after Hannah exited, so Isabella has no information about Jacob's knowledge (Step 12 and 13). Therefore, Isabella thinks Hannah thinks Jacob thinks the tomato is in the green_box.
