Answer: D. green_box

Explanation: 
1. Jacob thinks the tomato is in the green_box because he didn't witness any movements after Isabella moved it there.
2. Hannah also thinks the tomato is in the green_box because she didn't witness any movements after Isabella moved it there.
3. Elizabeth knows that Hannah thinks the tomato is in the green_box because she entered the bedroom after Hannah and didn't witness any movements by Hannah.
4. Isabella knows that Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container, but she doesn't know what Elizabeth thinks Hannah thinks.
5. Since Elizabeth trusts Isabella (who exited the room before her), she would think that Isabella thinks Hannah thinks the tomato is in the green_box.
