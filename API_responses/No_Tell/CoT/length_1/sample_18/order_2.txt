A. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation: Jackson exited the cellar before Charlotte moved the corn to the green_crate, so he believes the corn is still in the blue_treasure_chest. Benjamin also made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute, so he did not witness the corn being moved. Therefore, Jackson thinks Benjamin believes the corn is in the blue_treasure_chest.
