A. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation: 
1. The corn was initially in the blue_treasure_chest.
2. Charlotte moved the corn to the green_crate, but Liam and Benjamin were not present to witness this.
3. Liam and Benjamin entered the cellar after Charlotte exited, so they did not see the corn being moved.
4. Liam would think that Jackson, who exited before Charlotte moved the corn, would still believe the corn is in the blue_treasure_chest.
5. Since Benjamin also did not witness the corn being moved, Liam would think that Benjamin thinks the same as Jackson, which is that the corn is in the blue_treasure_chest.
