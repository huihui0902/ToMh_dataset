A. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation: Benjamin entered the cellar after Charlotte moved the corn to the green_crate. However, since Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute, he did not witness Charlotte moving the corn. Therefore, Benjamin would still believe the corn is in the blue_treasure_chest, as mentioned in line 2 of the story.
