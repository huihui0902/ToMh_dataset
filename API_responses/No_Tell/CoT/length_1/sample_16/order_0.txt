2. The carrot is initially in the red_container.
3. Isabella moves the carrot to the blue_container.
4. Logan likes the green_drawer (irrelevant information).
5. Isabella exits the cellar.
6. Evelyn stays in the cellar for 1 minute but makes no movements.
7. Logan likes the green_bucket (irrelevant information).
8. Evelyn exits the cellar.
9. William stays in the cellar for 1 minute but makes no movements.
10. William exits the cellar.
11. Alexander moves the carrot to the green_bathtub.
12. Alexander exits the cellar.
13. Logan moves the carrot back to the red_container.
