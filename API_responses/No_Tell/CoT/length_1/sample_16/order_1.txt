B. red_container

Explanation: William exited the cellar after Evelyn but before Alexander and Logan. Since he witnessed Isabella moving the carrot to the blue_container and didn't see any other movements, he would initially think the carrot is in the blue_container. However, since he trusts agents who exited the room later than himself, he would trust Alexander's action of moving the carrot to the green_bathtub. Finally, he would trust Logan's action of moving the carrot back to the red_container. Therefore, William really thinks the carrot is in the red_container.
