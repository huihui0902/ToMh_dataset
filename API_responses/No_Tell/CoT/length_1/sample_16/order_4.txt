B. red_container

Explanation:
1. William exited the cellar after Evelyn and before Alexander. So, he didn't see Alexander's or Logan's actions. He last saw the carrot in the blue_container (Isabella's action).
2. Evelyn exited the cellar before William and Alexander. She didn't see any actions related to the carrot after Isabella's action. So, she thinks William thinks the carrot is in the blue_container.
3. Logan exited the cellar after Alexander. He saw Alexander's action (moving the carrot to the green_bathtub) but not his own action. So, he thinks Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot is in the green_bathtub.
4. Alexander exited the cellar before Logan. He didn't see Logan's action. So, he thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot is in the green_bathtub.
5. However, since agents tend to lie, Alexander would trust Logan's action more than his own. Therefore, Alexander thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot is in the red_container (Logan's action).
