Answer: F. blue_bottle

Explanation: 
1. Elizabeth exited the bedroom before Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle, so Elizabeth thinks the banana is in the green_envelope.
2. Ava exited the bedroom after Elizabeth but before Abigail moved the banana, so Ava also thinks the banana is in the green_envelope.
3. Ella exited the bedroom after Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle but before Owen moved it back to the green_envelope. So, Ella thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle.
4. Since Elizabeth and Ava were in the same location (waiting_room) after Ella exited the bedroom, they can infer Ella's mental state. They know Ella exited the bedroom after Abigail, so they trust Ella's belief that the banana is in the blue_bottle.
5. Therefore, Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle (F).
