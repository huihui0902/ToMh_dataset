Answer: G. green_envelope

Explanation: In step 2, we learn that the banana is initially in the green_envelope. In step 8, Abigail moves the banana to the blue_bottle. However, in step 13, Owen moves the banana back to the green_envelope. Since Owen is the last person to exit the bedroom, the other agents would trust his action, and the banana is really in the green_envelope.
