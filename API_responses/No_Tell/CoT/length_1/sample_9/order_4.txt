Answer: F. blue_bottle

Explanation:
1. Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle (line 8) and exited the bedroom (line 9).
2. Ella entered the bedroom after Abigail and made no movements (line 11). She exited the bedroom (line 12). Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle.
3. Owen entered the bedroom after Ella and moved the banana to the green_envelope (line 13). He exited the bedroom (line 14). Owen thinks Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle.
4. Elizabeth and Ava exited the bedroom before Abigail, Ella, and Owen, so they don't have any information about the banana's location after their exit.
5. Owen thinks Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle because Elizabeth has no information about the banana's location after her exit, and Owen knows that Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle.
