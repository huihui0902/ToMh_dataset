Answer: F. blue_bottle

Explanation: Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle in step 8 and then exited the bedroom. Since she did not witness any further movements of the banana and did not have any interactions with other agents regarding the banana's location, she would still believe that the banana is in the blue_bottle.
