Answer: N. red_box

Explanation: Here is the step-by-step analysis of the story:

1. All five characters entered the closet.
2. The apple is initially in the green_bathtub.
3. Hannah moved the apple to the blue_cupboard.
4. Hannah exited the closet.
5. Jack moved the apple to the green_drawer.
6. Jack exited the closet.
7. Lily moved the apple to the red_box.
8-14. Various characters express their preferences and exit the closet, but no further movements of the apple occur.
15. All characters entered the waiting_room.

Since Lily was the last person to move the apple and there were no more movements after that, the apple is really in the red_box (Choice N).
