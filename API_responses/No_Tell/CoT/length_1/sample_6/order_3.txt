Answer: O. blue_cupboard

Explanation: 
1. Hannah moved the apple to the blue_cupboard and then exited the closet.
2. Jack entered the closet and moved the apple to the green_drawer, so he knows that Hannah last saw the apple in the blue_cupboard.
3. Lily entered the closet and moved the apple to the red_box. Jack knows that Lily last saw the apple in the red_box.
4. Since Jack exited the closet after Hannah, he knows that Hannah thinks the apple is in the blue_cupboard.
5. Jack also knows that Lily thinks the apple is in the red_box, but since he exited the closet after Lily, he trusts his own knowledge more.
6. Therefore, Jack thinks Hannah thinks Lily thinks the apple is in the blue_cupboard.
