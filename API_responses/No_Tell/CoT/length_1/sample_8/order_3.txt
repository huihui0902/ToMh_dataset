J. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
Ella exited the crawlspace before Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase. However, Chloe stayed in the crawlspace and witnessed Sophia moving the corn. Since Ella and Chloe were both in the crawlspace together, Ella can infer Chloe's mental state. Therefore, Ella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is in the blue_suitcase.
