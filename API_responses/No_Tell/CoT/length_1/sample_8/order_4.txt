J. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
1. Owen exits the crawlspace before Sophia moves the corn, so he thinks the corn is in the green_crate.
2. Ella exits the crawlspace before Sophia moves the corn, so she thinks the corn is in the green_crate.
3. Chloe exits the crawlspace before Sophia moves the corn, so she thinks the corn is in the green_crate.
4. Sophia moves the corn to the blue_suitcase, so she knows the corn is in the blue_suitcase.
5. Noah exits the crawlspace after Sophia moves the corn, so he knows the corn is in the blue_suitcase.

Since Owen thinks Ella thinks the corn is in the green_crate, and Ella thinks Chloe thinks the corn is in the green_crate, Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is in the green_crate. However, Sophia actually knows the corn is in the blue_suitcase. Since Chloe tends to trust agents who exit the room later than herself, she would trust Sophia's knowledge of the corn's location. Therefore, Owen thinks Ella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is in the blue_suitcase (J).
