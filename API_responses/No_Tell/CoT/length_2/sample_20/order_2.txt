A. blue_suitcase

Explanation: Emily last saw the peas in the red_basket (step 4) before exiting the bathroom. However, she knows that Ella, Avery, and Nathan were in the bathroom after her and could have moved the peas. Since Nathan was the last person to exit the bathroom, Emily would trust Nathan's action the most. In step 12, Nathan moved the peas to the blue_suitcase. Therefore, Emily would think that Nathan thinks the peas are in the blue_suitcase.
