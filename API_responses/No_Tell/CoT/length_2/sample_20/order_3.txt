A. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
Let's break down the story step by step:

1. Emily moves the peas to the red_basket.
2. Ella moves the peas to the red_envelope.
3. Avery moves the peas to the blue_cupboard.
4. Nathan moves the peas to the blue_suitcase.

Now, let's analyze the question: Where does Ella think Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas is?

1. Ella knows that Emily moved the peas to the red_basket.
2. Ella moved the peas to the red_envelope, so she thinks Emily would think the peas are in the red_basket.
3. Ella knows that Nathan moved the peas to the blue_suitcase after Avery moved them to the blue_cupboard. So, Ella thinks Emily would think Nathan thinks the peas are in the blue_suitcase.

Therefore, the answer is A. blue_suitcase.
