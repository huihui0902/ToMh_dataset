A. blue_suitcase

Explanation: Nathan was the last person to move the peas before exiting the bathroom. He moved the peas to the blue_suitcase (step 12). Since there were no further movements of the peas after Nathan's action, and he has no reason to believe otherwise, Nathan really thinks the peas are in the blue_suitcase.
