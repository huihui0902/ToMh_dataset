A. blue_suitcase

Explanation: The peas were initially in the blue_suitcase (line 3). They were moved to the red_basket (line 4), then to the red_envelope (line 6), then to the blue_cupboard (line 8), and finally back to the blue_suitcase (line 12). Since no other movements were made after Nathan moved the peas to the blue_suitcase, that is their current location.
