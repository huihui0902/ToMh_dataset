Answer: L. red_box

Explanation: When Isla exited the hall, the lemon was in the red_container (step 6). However, Isla did not witness the lemon being moved to the red_container (step 3) because she made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute (step 5). Therefore, Isla thinks the lemon is still in the red_box (step 2). Sophia entered the waiting_room with Isla (step 13) but did not witness any further movements of the lemon. Thus, Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in the red_box. Finally, Evelyn entered the waiting_room with Sophia (step 13) and also did not witness any further movements of the lemon. So, Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in the red_box.
