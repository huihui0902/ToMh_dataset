Answer: O. red_container

Explanation: Isla entered the hall with the others and stayed there until step 6. During that time, she witnessed Evelyn moving the lemon from the red_box to the red_container in step 3. Since Isla didn't witness any other movements of the lemon and didn't have any interactions with the others after that, she would believe the lemon is still in the red_container.
