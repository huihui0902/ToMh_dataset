K. green_bottle

Explanation:
The lemon's location changes throughout the story as follows:
1. In the red_box (line 2)
2. Moved to the red_container by Evelyn (line 3)
3. Moved to the green_treasure_chest by Alexander (line 7)
4. Moved to the green_bottle by Emma (line 9)

Since Sophia made no movements and was the last person to exit the hall, the other agents would trust her knowledge of the lemon's location. However, she didn't move the lemon or make any claims about its location. Therefore, the lemon is still in the green_bottle (line 9).
