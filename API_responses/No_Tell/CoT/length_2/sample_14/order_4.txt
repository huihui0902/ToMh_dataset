2. Sophia entered the hall after Isla exited, so she has no new information about the lemon's location. Therefore, Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in the red_container.
3. Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container (step 3) and then exited the hall. She has no information about any further movements of the lemon. So, Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in the red_container.
4. Alexander entered the waiting_room with Evelyn (step 13), so he knows that Evelyn has no new information about the lemon's location. Therefore, Alexander thinks Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in the red_container.
