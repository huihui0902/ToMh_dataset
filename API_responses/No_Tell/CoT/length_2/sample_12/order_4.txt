Answer: M. red_bucket

Explanation: 
1. William and Ava both exited the pantry before Charlotte moved the pear to the red_bucket, so they both think the pear is in the red_box.
2. Charlotte knows she moved the pear to the red_bucket.
3. Avery and Alexander entered the pantry after Charlotte moved the pear, so they both think the pear is in the red_bucket.
4. Since Ava trusts Alexander (who exited the pantry later than her), she would believe him if he told her the pear is in the red_bucket.
5. William thinks Ava thinks the pear is in the red_bucket because he knows Ava trusts Alexander, who knows the pear's actual location.
