E. green_bucket

Explanation:
When Nathan last left the basement (step 12), the corn was in the red_basket (step 13 had not happened yet). However, when Abigail exited the basement (step 22), she had moved the corn to the green_bucket. Since Nathan was not in the basement to witness this change, he would assume that Abigail thinks the corn is in the green_bucket, as she was the one who moved it there.
