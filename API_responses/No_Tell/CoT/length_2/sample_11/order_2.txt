Answer: H. blue_suitcase

Explanation: Lily was in the pantry when Emily moved the cherry to the red_container (step 3) and then exited. Lily made no movements and exited the pantry (step 6). After Lily left, Emma moved the cherry to the green_envelope (step 7) and then Avery moved it to the blue_suitcase (step 9). Since Lily exited the pantry before Emma and Avery made their movements, she is not aware of those changes. However, she knows that Avery exited the pantry after her, so she would trust Avery's knowledge of the cherry's location. Therefore, Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
