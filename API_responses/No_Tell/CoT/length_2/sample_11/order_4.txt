Answer: H. blue_suitcase

Explanation: 
1. Emily moved the cherry to the red_container and then exited the pantry. She doesn't know about the subsequent movements of the cherry.
2. Lily didn't move the cherry and exited the pantry after Emily, so she knows the cherry is in the red_container.
3. Emma moved the cherry to the green_envelope and exited the pantry. She knows the cherry is in the green_envelope.
4. Avery moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase and exited the pantry. She knows the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
5. Ella didn't move the cherry and exited the pantry after everyone else. She knows the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.

Now, let's analyze the question step by step:
- Where does Emily think Ella thinks Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is?

1. Emily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is in the red_container because that's where Emily left it, and she doesn't know about the subsequent movements.
2. Emily thinks Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is in the red_container because Lily exited the pantry after Emily and didn't move the cherry.
3. Emily thinks Ella thinks Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase because Ella exited the pantry after everyone else and knows the cherry's actual location.

So, the answer is H. blue_suitcase.
