H. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
1. Emily moved the cherry from the red_drawer to the red_container (step 3).
2. Emma moved the cherry from the red_container to the green_envelope (step 7).
3. Avery moved the cherry from the green_envelope to the blue_suitcase (step 9).

No other movements were made regarding the cherry, so it is currently in the blue_suitcase.
