A. red_basket

Explanation: Owen last saw the carrot in the green_drawer (step 7). However, after Owen exited the hall, Lily moved the carrot to the red_envelope (step 10), and then Noah moved it to the red_basket (step 12). Since Owen, Noah, and Mila entered the waiting_room together (step 28), Owen can infer that Noah knows the latest location of the carrot, which is the red_basket.
