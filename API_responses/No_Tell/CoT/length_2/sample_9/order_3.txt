A. red_basket

Explanation:
1. Noah moved the carrot to the red_basket and then exited the hall (lines 12 and 14).
2. Owen entered the sunroom with Noah and Mila (line 18), so Owen knows that Noah's last knowledge of the carrot's location is the red_basket.
3. Mila was in the sunroom with Owen (line 18), so she knows that Owen knows Noah's last knowledge of the carrot's location is the red_basket.

Therefore, Mila thinks Owen thinks Noah thinks the carrot is in the red_basket.
