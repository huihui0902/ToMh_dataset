Answer: O. green_crate

Explanation: 
1. Liam moved the peas to the blue_container (step 3) and then exited the workshop (step 5).
2. Noah moved the peas to the green_crate (step 6) and then exited the workshop (step 7). Liam didn't witness this, but Noah knows.
3. Avery moved the peas to the blue_bucket (step 8) and then exited the workshop (step 9). Noah didn't witness this.
4. Mila moved the peas to the blue_crate (step 10) and then exited the workshop (step 12). Neither Noah nor Liam witnessed this.
5. Benjamin made no movements (step 13) and then exited the workshop (step 14). He didn't witness any changes after Noah's action.

Liam thinks Noah thinks the peas are in the green_crate because that's where Noah moved them before exiting the workshop. Liam doesn't know about the subsequent movements by Avery and Mila, and neither does Noah. Benjamin didn't witness any changes after Noah's action, so Liam thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas are in the green_crate.
