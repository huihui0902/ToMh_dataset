M. blue_crate

Explanation:
Benjamin entered the workshop with the others and stayed until everyone else left. He witnessed the following movements of the peas:
- Liam moved the peas to the blue_container (step 3)
- Noah moved the peas to the green_crate (step 6)
- Avery moved the peas to the blue_bucket (step 8)
- Mila moved the peas to the blue_crate (step 10)

Since Benjamin saw all these movements, he would believe the peas are in the blue_crate.
