Answer: G. green_basket

Explanation: Owen moved the melon to the green_basket in step 3 and then exited the bedroom in step 4. Since Owen did not witness any further movements of the melon and did not have any interactions with the other agents regarding the melon's location, he still believes the melon is in the green_basket.
