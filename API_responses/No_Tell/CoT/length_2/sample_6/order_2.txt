G. green_basket

Explanation:
Avery entered the bedroom after Owen moved the melon to the green_basket (step 3) and before Mila moved it to the green_box (step 11). Since Avery exited the bedroom before Mila moved the melon, Avery would think that Owen still believes the melon is in the green_basket.
