Answer: F. red_pantry

Explanation: 
1. Owen moved the melon to the green_basket and exited the bedroom (lines 3 and 4).
2. Avery entered the bedroom after Owen, so Avery doesn't know about the melon being moved to the green_basket (line 1).
3. Benjamin entered the bedroom after Avery, so Benjamin knows that Avery doesn't know about the melon being moved to the green_basket (line 1).
4. Mila moved the melon to the green_box and exited the bedroom (lines 11 and 12).
5. Noah moved the melon to the red_pantry and exited the bedroom (lines 13 and 14).

Since Benjamin exited the bedroom before Mila and Noah, he doesn't know about the melon being moved to the green_box or the red_pantry. He knows that Avery doesn't know about the melon being moved to the green_basket. Therefore, Benjamin thinks Avery thinks Owen thinks the melon is in the red_pantry, which is its original location (line 2).
