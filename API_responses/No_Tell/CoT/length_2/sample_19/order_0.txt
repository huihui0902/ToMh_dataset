K. blue_container

Explanation: The tomato's location changes as follows:
1. Initially, it is in the blue_container (line 2).
2. Sophia moves it to the blue_cupboard (line 3).
3. Jackson moves it to the blue_crate (line 5).
4. Nathan moves it back to the blue_container (line 11).

Since there are no more movements involving the tomato after line 11, its final location is the blue_container.
