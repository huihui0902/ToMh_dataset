Answer: L. blue_crate

Explanation: Nathan last saw the tomato in the blue_container (step 11). However, he knows that Jackson exited the laundry after him (step 6), so he would be aware that Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate (step 5). Therefore, Nathan thinks that Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_crate.
