Answer: C. green_box

Explanation: Aiden was in the staircase when the cabbage was in the green_box (line 17). He made no movements and exited the staircase (lines 18-19). Avery entered the staircase after Aiden and moved the cabbage to the green_envelope (line 20). However, Aiden did not witness this change, so he still believes that Avery thinks the cabbage is in the green_box.
