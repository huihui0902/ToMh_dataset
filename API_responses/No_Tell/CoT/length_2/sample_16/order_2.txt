L. green_bottle

Explanation:
Liam was present in the den when the tangerine was moved to the green_bottle (step 12) by Sophia. After that, Liam, Jackson, Carter, Benjamin, and Sophia all entered the waiting_room (step 14). Since Liam and Benjamin were in the same location (waiting_room), Liam can infer Benjamin's mental state. Since there were no more movements of the tangerine after step 12 and before Liam and Benjamin entered the waiting_room, Liam would think that Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the green_bottle.
