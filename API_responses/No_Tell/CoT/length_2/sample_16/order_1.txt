L. green_bottle

Explanation:
Benjamin last saw the tangerine in the red_bucket (step 10) before exiting the den. However, Sophia moved the tangerine to the green_bottle (step 12) after Benjamin exited the den. Since Benjamin, Liam, and Carter entered the waiting_room together (step 25), Benjamin would trust Liam and Carter's knowledge of the tangerine's location. Liam exited the den after Benjamin (step 5), so Benjamin would trust Liam's knowledge. Liam last saw the tangerine in the green_bathtub (step 6). However, since Sophia exited the den after Liam (step 13), Benjamin would trust Sophia's knowledge more. Sophia moved the tangerine to the green_bottle (step 12), so Benjamin would believe the tangerine is in the green_bottle.
