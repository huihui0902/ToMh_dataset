L. green_bottle

Explanation:
1. Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the red_bucket (step 10).
2. Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the red_bucket (step 20).
3. Carter thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the red_bucket (step 24).
4. Jackson thinks Carter thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the green_bottle (step 13), because Jackson exited the den after Benjamin and before Carter, so he knows that Sophia moved the tangerine to the green_bottle after Benjamin moved it to the red_bucket.
