A. green_envelope

Explanation: Avery exited the workshop after step 4, so Avery's last knowledge of the watermelon's location is in the blue_suitcase. However, Avery knows that Sophia moved the watermelon to the green_envelope (step 5) before exiting the workshop. Since Carter entered the workshop after Sophia, Avery would think that Carter believes the watermelon is in the green_envelope.
