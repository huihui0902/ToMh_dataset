D. green_basket

Explanation: The watermelon's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the blue_suitcase (line 2). Then, Sophia moved it to the green_envelope (line 5). Finally, Carter moved it to the green_basket (line 8). Since no other movements were made regarding the watermelon after that, its final location is the green_basket.
