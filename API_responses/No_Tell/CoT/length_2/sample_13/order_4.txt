Answer: D. green_basket

Explanation:
1. Carter moved the watermelon to the green_basket and then exited the workshop (Step 8 and 9).
2. Avery, Emily, and Isla did not witness this change, as they made no movements in the workshop after Carter's exit (Steps 3, 10, and 12).
3. Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is in the green_basket because Carter was the last one to move it.
4. Isla did not witness any changes to the watermelon's location, so she would trust Avery's belief since Avery exited the workshop later than her (Step 13).
5. Sophia would trust Isla's belief since Isla exited the sunroom later than Avery (Step 21).
6. Therefore, Sophia thinks Isla thinks Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is in the green_basket.
