M. blue_container

Explanation:
Noah exited the staircase before Sophia moved the corn to the blue_container (steps 9 and 10). Since Noah was not present when Sophia moved the corn, he would not have witnessed the change. However, all agents entered the waiting_room together (step 15), and Noah would have been able to infer Sophia's mental state. Since agents tend to trust agents who exited the room later than themselves, Noah would trust Sophia's knowledge and believe that the corn is in the blue_container.
