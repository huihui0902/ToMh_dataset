Answer: N. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation: Nathan moved the melon to the blue_treasure_chest in step 8 and then exited the hallway in step 9. Since there were no further movements of the melon after Nathan's action, and he did not have any interactions with other agents that would change his belief, Nathan really thinks the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest.
