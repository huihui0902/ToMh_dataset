Answer: C. red_container

Explanation: 
1. Amelia thinks the corn is in the red_basket because she moved it there before exiting the hallway.
2. Lily doesn't know about Amelia's action, so she thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the red_container (where Liam left it).
3. Sophia knows that Lily exited the hallway after Amelia, so she trusts Lily's belief. Therefore, Sophia thinks Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the red_container.
