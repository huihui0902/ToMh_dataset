G. green_treasure_chest

Explanation:
Initially, the cucumber is in the green_treasure_chest (line 2). Then, the following movements occur:
- Evelyn moves the cucumber to the red_envelope (line 5).
- Charlotte moves the cucumber to the red_crate (line 7).
- Jacob moves the cucumber back to the green_treasure_chest (line 11).

Since there are no more movements involving the cucumber after line 11, the cucumber is really in the green_treasure_chest.
