F. red_envelope

Explanation: Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red_envelope in step 5 and then exited the dining_room in step 6. Since Evelyn exited the room before Charlotte and Jacob made their moves, she would not have witnessed the cucumber being moved to the red_crate or back to the green_treasure_chest. Therefore, Evelyn really thinks the cucumber is in the red_envelope.
