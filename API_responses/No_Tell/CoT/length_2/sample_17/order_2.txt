C. blue_drawer

Explanation: Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer because Owen exited the front_yard after Lily moved the lime to the blue_drawer (step 4) and before Evelyn moved it to the green_pantry (step 10). Since Owen didn't witness the lime being moved to the green_pantry, Emily would assume that Owen still believes the lime is in the blue_drawer.
