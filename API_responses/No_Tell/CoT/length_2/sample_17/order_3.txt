C. blue_drawer

Explanation:
1. Lily moved the lime to the blue_drawer (step 4) and then exited the front_yard (step 5).
2. Owen stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute (step 8) and then exited, so he didn't see Evelyn move the lime to the green_pantry (step 10). Therefore, Owen thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer.
3. Emily stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute (step 13) and then exited, so she also didn't see Evelyn move the lime to the green_pantry (step 10). Therefore, Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer.
4. Lily and Emily were in the same location (the attic) in steps 16-23, so Lily can infer Emily's mental state. Since Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer, Lily would also think the same.
