B. green_pantry

Explanation: In the story, the lime's location changes as follows:
1. The lime is initially in the red_bottle (line 3).
2. Lily moves the lime to the blue_drawer (line 4).
3. Evelyn moves the lime to the green_pantry (line 10).

No further movements of the lime are mentioned, so the lime is really in the green_pantry.
