C. blue_drawer

Explanation:
Owen was in the front_yard until step 9. At that time, the lime was in the blue_drawer (step 4). Since Owen didn't witness any other movements of the lime and didn't have any interactions with other agents that could change his belief, he still thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer.
