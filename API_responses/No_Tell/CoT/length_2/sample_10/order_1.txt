A. red_container

Hannah thinks the orange is in the red_container because she exited the master_bedroom after Jack moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest but before Chloe moved it to the red_container. Since agents tend to trust agents who exited the room later than themselves, Hannah would trust Chloe's action and believe the orange is in the red_container.
