Answer: D. red_basket

Explanation: Chloe exited the crawlspace after Evelyn but before Mila, Isabella, and Jacob. When Chloe left, the potato was still in the blue_drawer. However, she knows that Mila moved the potato to the red_basket after she left. Since Chloe and Isabella have not had any private or public interactions, Chloe would assume that Isabella thinks the potato is in the red_basket, as that was its location when Isabella entered the crawlspace.
