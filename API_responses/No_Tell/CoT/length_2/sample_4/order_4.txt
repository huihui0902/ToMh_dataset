Answer: D. red_basket

Explanation:
Step 1: Jacob thinks Isabella thinks the potato is in the green_bottle because that's where she left it (step 9).
Step 2: Chloe thinks Isabella thinks the potato is in the green_bottle because she exited the crawlspace before Isabella moved the potato (step 6).
Step 3: Evelyn thinks Chloe thinks Isabella thinks the potato is in the green_bottle because she exited the crawlspace before Chloe (step 4).
Step 4: Jacob thinks Evelyn thinks Chloe thinks Isabella thinks the potato is in the red_basket because he knows that Evelyn trusts Mila more than herself (step 19), and Mila moved the potato to the red_basket (step 7).
