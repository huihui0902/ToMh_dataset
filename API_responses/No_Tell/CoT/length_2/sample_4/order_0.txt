B. blue_drawer

Explanation: The potato's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the blue_drawer (line 2). Mila moved it to the red_basket (line 7), Isabella moved it to the green_bottle (line 9), and finally, Jacob moved it back to the blue_drawer (line 11). Since there were no more movements involving the potato after Jacob's action, the potato is really in the blue_drawer.
