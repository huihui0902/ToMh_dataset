Answer: B. blue_drawer

Explanation: Isabella moved the potato to the green_bottle in step 9 and then exited the crawlspace. However, Jacob moved the potato back to the blue_drawer in step 11. Since Isabella was not in the crawlspace when Jacob made this move, she would not have witnessed it. However, all agents entered the waiting_room in step 13, and Isabella would have been able to infer Jacob's mental state. Since agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later than themselves, Isabella would trust Jacob's knowledge of the potato's location. Therefore, Isabella really thinks the potato is in the blue_drawer.
