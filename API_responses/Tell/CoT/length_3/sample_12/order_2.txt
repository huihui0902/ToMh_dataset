L. green_pantry

Hannah thinks Avery thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry because Avery privately told Noah that the spinach is in the green_pantry (line 16). Although agents tend to lie, Hannah has no other information about Avery's belief regarding the spinach's location, so she would assume that Avery thinks it is in the green_pantry.
