L. red_envelope

Explanation: Abigail really thinks the carrot is in the red_envelope. In step 13, Abigail moved the carrot to the red_envelope. She then exited the front_yard in step 14. Since she did not witness any further movements of the carrot and did not have any interactions that would change her belief, her belief remains that the carrot is in the red_envelope.
