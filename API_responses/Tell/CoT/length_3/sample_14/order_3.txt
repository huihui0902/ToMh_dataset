L. red_envelope

Explanation:
Avery was not present when Isabella privately told Nathan that the carrot is in the green_crate (step 40). The last information Avery has about the carrot's location is from step 16, when Isabella publicly claimed that the carrot is in the red_envelope. Since Abigail privately told Nathan the same thing (step 17), Avery would think that Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the carrot is in the red_envelope.
