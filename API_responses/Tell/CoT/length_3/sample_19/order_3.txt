L. blue_container

Explanation:
1. In line 16, William publicly claimed that the cherry is in the blue_container. So, Ava knows that William thinks the cherry is in the blue_container.
2. In line 38, Ava publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_basket. However, since agents tend to lie, Logan would not believe Ava's claim and would still think that Ava believes William's claim.
3. Therefore, Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is in the blue_container.
