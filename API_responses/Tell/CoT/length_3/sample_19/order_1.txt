L. blue_container

Explanation: In step 16, William publicly claimed that the cherry is in the blue_container. This is the only information we have about William's belief regarding the cherry's location. Although Amelia privately told William that the cherry is in the green_pantry (step 17), we should assume that every agent tends to lie, so William's belief would not be affected by Amelia's statement.
