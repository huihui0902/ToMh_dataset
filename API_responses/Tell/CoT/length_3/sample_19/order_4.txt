L. blue_container

Explanation:
1. William publicly claimed that the cherry is in the blue_container (line 16). So, Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is in the blue_container.
2. Logan privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container (line 39). So, Amelia thinks Logan thinks the cherry is in the blue_container.
3. The question asks where Amelia thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. Since Amelia thinks Logan thinks the cherry is in the blue_container, and Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is in the blue_container, the answer is L. blue_container.
