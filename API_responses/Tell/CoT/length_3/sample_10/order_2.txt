C. green_box

Explanation: Mila moved the persimmon to the green_box in step 7 and then exited the back_yard in step 9. Emily was not present in the back_yard after Mila moved the persimmon, so she has no information about the subsequent movements of the persimmon. Therefore, Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is in the green_box.
