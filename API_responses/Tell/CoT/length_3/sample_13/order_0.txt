B. green_crate

Explanation: The onion's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the green_crate (line 4). Then, Lily moved it to the blue_bucket (line 11). Later, Abigail moved it to the red_bucket (line 29). Finally, Emily moved it back to the green_crate (line 35). Since there were no more movements of the onion after that, the onion is really in the green_crate.
