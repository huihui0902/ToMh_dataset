D. blue_bucket

Explanation:
1. Mila privately told Jack that the onion is in the blue_bucket (step 17).
2. Jack has no other information about the onion's location after that, so he still believes it is in the blue_bucket.
3. Since Jack has not interacted with Abigail after step 17, he has no reason to think that Abigail's belief about Mila's belief has changed. Therefore, Jack thinks Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is in the blue_bucket.
