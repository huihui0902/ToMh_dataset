Answer: H. blue_pantry

Explanation: 
1. Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard (step 7).
2. Avery moved the turnip to the red_envelope (step 9).
3. Avery publicly claimed that the turnip is in the blue_pantry (step 14).
4. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope (step 15).

Carter heard Avery's public claim (blue_pantry) and Isla's private claim (red_envelope). Since Carter tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself, he believes Isla's claim (red_envelope). 

Mila exited the sunroom before Avery made the public claim (step 6), so she doesn't know about the claim. Therefore, Carter thinks Mila doesn't have any information about the turnip's location after it was moved from the green_pantry.

Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard (step 7) but doesn't know about Avery's action (step 9). Since Mila doesn't know about the public claim, Carter thinks Mila believes Owen still thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard.

However, since agents tend to lie, Carter would assume that Owen lied about the turnip's location. Since the turnip was originally in the green_pantry, Carter would think that Mila thinks Owen lied and placed it in the blue_pantry instead.
