I. red_envelope

Explanation: In step 9, Avery moved the turnip to the red_envelope. There were no further movements of the turnip mentioned in the story. Although Avery publicly claimed that the turnip is in the blue_pantry (step 14), we know that agents tend to lie. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope (step 15), which is consistent with the actual location of the turnip.
