J. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
Mila exited the sunroom before Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard (step 6 and 7). Since Mila has not had any interaction with Owen or any other character regarding the turnip's location after that, she would still believe that the turnip is where Owen last moved it, which is the blue_cupboard.
