Answer: H. blue_pantry

Explanation: 
1. Owen thinks the turnip is in the red_envelope because he moved it to the blue_cupboard and then Avery moved it to the red_envelope.
2. Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard because she exited the sunroom before Owen moved the turnip.
3. Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard because he exited the sunroom before Mila and didn't witness Owen's action.
4. Isla thinks Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is in the blue_pantry because she heard Avery's public claim that the turnip is in the blue_pantry and she knows Carter heard it too. Since Isla knows that agents tend to lie, she believes Carter would trust Avery's claim over his own knowledge.
