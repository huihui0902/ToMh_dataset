A. green_bottle

Amelia really thinks the lime is in the green_bottle because she publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle in step 15. Although agents tend to lie, there is no information suggesting that Amelia has a reason to lie about her belief in this case. Additionally, Amelia exited the porch after Chloe moved the lime to the green_envelope, so she did not witness any further movements of the lime.
