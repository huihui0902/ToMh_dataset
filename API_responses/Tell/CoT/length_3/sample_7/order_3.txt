A. green_bottle

Explanation:
Step 1: Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle (line 15). Chloe was in the waiting_room at that time, so she heard Amelia's claim.
Step 2: Sophia privately told Benjamin that the lime is in the green_bottle (line 16). Chloe was not present during this private conversation, so she doesn't know about it.
Step 3: Chloe moved the lime to the green_envelope (line 7), but she doesn't know that Sophia knows this because they haven't been in the same location or had any interactions about it.
Step 4: Since Chloe heard Amelia's public claim and doesn't know about Sophia's private conversation with Benjamin, she thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle.
