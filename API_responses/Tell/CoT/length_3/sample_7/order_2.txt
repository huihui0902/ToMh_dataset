A. green_bottle

Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle because Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle in step 15. Although agents tend to lie, Sophia has no other information to contradict Amelia's claim, and she herself moved the lime to the green_bottle in step 11.
