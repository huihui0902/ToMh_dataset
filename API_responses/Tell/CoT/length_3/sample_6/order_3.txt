B. red_container

Explanation:
In step 16, Isabella publicly claimed that the orange is in the blue_bucket. However, in step 43, Hannah privately told Isabella that the orange is in the blue_bottle. Since Jacob was not present during the private conversation between Hannah and Isabella, he is not aware of it. Therefore, Jacob thinks Isabella thinks the orange is in the blue_bucket.

In step 17, Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container. Since Isabella was not present during the private conversation between Owen and Hannah, she is not aware of it. Therefore, Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is in the blue_bucket.

Finally, since Jacob thinks Isabella thinks the orange is in the blue_bucket, and Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is in the blue_bucket, Jacob thinks Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is in the blue_bucket. However, since every agent tends to lie, Jacob would believe the opposite of what Isabella claims. Therefore, Jacob thinks Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is in the red_container (B).
