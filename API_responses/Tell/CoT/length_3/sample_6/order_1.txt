B. red_container

Owen really thinks the orange is in the red_container because he privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container (step 17). Although Isabella publicly claimed that the orange is in the blue_bucket (step 16), Owen did not change his belief since he exited the laundry after Isabella (step 14 and 15) and therefore trusts his own observation more. Additionally, what Hannah privately told Isabella (step 43) does not affect Owen's belief as they did not have any private or public interactions regarding the orange's location.
