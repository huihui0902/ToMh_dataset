C. blue_bucket

Explanation: The orange's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the green_box (line 2). Then, Jacob moved it to the blue_bottle (line 6), and Jackson moved it to the red_container (line 9). Finally, Isabella moved the orange to the blue_bucket (line 34). Since there were no more movements of the orange after that, the orange is really in the blue_bucket.
