A. blue_crate

Explanation:
Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas are in the blue_crate because Jack moved the peas to the red_crate (step 8) and Jackson exited the hallway before that (step 7). Jackson has no knowledge of the subsequent movements of the peas, and he has not had any private or public interactions with Jack after that. Therefore, Jackson would still believe that Jack likes the blue_crate (step 6) and would assume that Jack thinks the peas are in the blue_crate.
