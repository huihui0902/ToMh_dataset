I. blue_container

Explanation:
Step 1: Carter publicly claimed that the watermelon is in the red_envelope (line 15).
Step 2: Isla privately told Carter that the watermelon is in the blue_container (line 16).
Step 3: Elizabeth entered the kitchen with Jacob and Carter (line 17). She witnessed the watermelon being moved from the blue_cupboard to the red_envelope by Jacob (line 19) and then moved it herself to the blue_container (line 23).
Step 4: Elizabeth knows that Carter was in the kitchen with her and saw her move the watermelon to the blue_container (line 23). So, she believes that Carter thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.
Step 5: Since Elizabeth and Isla have not had any private or public interactions about the watermelon's location, Elizabeth has no reason to think that Isla's belief about the watermelon's location has changed. Therefore, Elizabeth thinks Carter thinks Isla thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.
