M. red_drawer

Explanation:
In step 16, Jack privately told Jacob that the spinach is in the red_drawer. Jackson was not present during this conversation, so he is not aware of it. However, in step 17, Jackson, Jacob, and Ella entered the laundry, and in step 18, they found the spinach in the red_drawer. Since Jackson and Jacob were both present when they found the spinach in the red_drawer, Jackson would think that Jacob thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer.
