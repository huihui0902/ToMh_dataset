M. red_drawer

Explanation:
Jacob's belief about the location of the spinach is based on the information he has received and witnessed. In step 16, Jack privately told Jacob that the spinach is in the red_drawer. Since Jacob has not witnessed any other movements related to the spinach after that, and he tends to trust Jack who exited the room later than himself, Jacob really thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer.
