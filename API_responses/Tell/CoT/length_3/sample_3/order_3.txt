M. red_drawer

Explanation:
Step 1: Jack privately told Jacob that the spinach is in the red_drawer (line 16).
Step 2: Since Jackson and Jacob were in the same location (the waiting_room) after that (line 27), Jackson can infer Jacob's mental state and know that Jacob thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer.
Step 3: Jack privately told Jackson that the tomato is in the green_bucket (line 41). Since this is a private communication, Jack knows that Jackson is aware of his belief about the tomato, but it doesn't affect his belief about the spinach.
Step 4: Therefore, Jack thinks Jackson thinks Jacob thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer.
