O. green_crate

Explanation:
The last time the spinach was moved was in step 19, where Jackson moved the spinach to the green_crate. After that, no other movements were made involving the spinach. Although there were private and public claims about the location of the spinach, these claims were not accurate, as the agents tend to lie. Therefore, the spinach is really in the green_crate.
