B. green_crate

Explanation:
Initially, the turnip is in the green_crate (line 2). Liam moves it to the blue_pantry (line 5), and then William moves it to the red_bottle (line 7). When Sophia, Benjamin, and Hannah re-enter the porch (line 18), the turnip is still in the red_bottle (line 19). Sophia moves it to the green_basket (line 20), and then Benjamin moves it back to the green_crate (line 22). No further movements of the turnip are mentioned, so it remains in the green_crate.
