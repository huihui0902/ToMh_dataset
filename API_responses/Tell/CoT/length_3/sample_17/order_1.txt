D. red_bottle

Explanation: In step 16, William privately told Sophia that the turnip is in the red_bottle. Since William moved the turnip to the red_bottle in step 7 and exited the porch, he did not witness any further movements of the turnip. Therefore, he really thinks the turnip is in the red_bottle.
