2. Liam knows that Hannah thinks the turnip is in the green_crate (step 17).
3. Liam knows that Benjamin exited the porch after Sophia (step 23), so he would assume that Benjamin trusts Sophia's information more than his own. Since Sophia moved the turnip to the green_basket (step 20), Liam would think that Benjamin thinks the turnip is in the green_basket.
