D. red_bottle

Explanation:
Benjamin was not present when Liam moved the turnip to the blue_pantry (step 5) or when William moved it to the red_bottle (step 7). However, Benjamin was present when William privately told Sophia that the turnip is in the red_bottle (step 16). Since Benjamin has no other information about the turnip's location and tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself, he would believe that William thinks the turnip is in the red_bottle.
