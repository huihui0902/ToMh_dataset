F. green_bucket

Explanation:
Step 1: Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is in the green_bucket because Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket (line 15), and Aiden was not present during this conversation.
Step 2: Aiden thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is in the green_bucket because William publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the green_envelope (line 14), but Aiden knows the cabbage is in the green_bucket (line 26). Since Carter was present when William made the false claim, Aiden assumes Carter knows the truth as well.
