G. green_crate

Explanation:
Step 1: William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate (line 38). So, Carter thinks the cabbage is in the green_crate.
Step 2: Avery exited the office after moving the cabbage to the green_crate (line 33). Since Avery was the last person to exit the office, Carter would trust Avery's action and think the cabbage is in the green_crate.
Step 3: Aiden publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the green_basket (line 37). However, since Avery was in the office with Aiden and knows that Aiden tends to lie, Avery would still think the cabbage is in the green_crate.
Step 4: William heard Aiden's public claim about the green_basket (line 37), but since William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate (line 38), he would think that Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is in the green_crate.
