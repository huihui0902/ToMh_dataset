F. green_bucket

Carter really thinks the cabbage is in the green_bucket. This is because William publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the green_envelope (step 14), but Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket (step 15). Since Carter was in the same location as Charlotte and Avery when they entered the office (step 16), he can infer their mental state and trust Charlotte's information more than William's public claim. Additionally, Carter did not witness any changes to the cabbage's location while he was in the office, so he has no reason to believe it has been moved from the green_bucket.
