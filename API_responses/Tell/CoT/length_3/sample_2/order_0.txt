D. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
Initially, the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest (line 3). Ella moves it to the blue_bottle (line 5), and then Owen moves it to the green_envelope (line 7). Finally, Aiden moves the melon to the blue_suitcase (line 11). No further movements of the melon are mentioned in the story, so the melon is really in the blue_suitcase.
