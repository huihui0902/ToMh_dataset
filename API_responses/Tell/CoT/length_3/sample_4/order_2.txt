F. green_bottle

Explanation: In step 15, Amelia publicly claimed that the corn is in the green_bottle. Nathan was present in the waiting_room at that time, so he heard Amelia's claim. Since Nathan has no other information about Amelia's belief regarding the corn's location, he would think that Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.
