F. green_bottle

Amelia really thinks the corn is in the green_bottle because she publicly claimed it in step 15. Although Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope in step 16, we should assume that every agent tends to lie, so Amelia would not change her belief based on Abigail's statement.
