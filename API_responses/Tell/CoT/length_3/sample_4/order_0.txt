F. green_bottle

Explanation:
Following the story, we can track the movements of the corn:
2. The corn starts in the green_bottle.
3. Nathan moves the corn to the red_envelope.
6. Lily moves the corn to the green_envelope.
8. Amelia moves the corn to the green_drawer.
10. Alexander moves the corn to the green_box.
12. Abigail moves the corn back to the green_bottle.

Since there are no more movements of the corn after step 12, the corn is really in the green_bottle.
