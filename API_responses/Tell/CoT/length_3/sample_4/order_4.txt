F. green_bottle

Explanation:
1. Amelia publicly claimed that the corn is in the green_bottle (step 15). This is what Amelia thinks.
2. Nathan was present when Amelia made the public claim, so he thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.
3. Lily was also present when Amelia made the public claim, so she thinks Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.
4. Alexander was not present during Amelia's public claim, but he entered the waiting_room with Lily (step 36). Since Lily tends to trust Amelia (who exited the room later than herself), Alexander can infer that Lily thinks Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.
