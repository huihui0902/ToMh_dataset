F. green_envelope

Explanation: Noah thinks Aiden thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope because Noah publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_envelope in step 17. Aiden has not had any private or public interactions with Noah regarding the cherry's location since then, so Noah would still believe that Aiden thinks it's in the green_envelope.
