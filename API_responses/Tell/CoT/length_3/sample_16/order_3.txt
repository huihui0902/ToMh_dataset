F. green_envelope

Explanation:
Step 1: Owen thinks Noah thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope because Noah publicly claimed it in step 17.
Step 2: Owen has no information about Aiden's thoughts on the cherry's location, but he knows that Aiden was present when Noah made the public claim. So, Owen would assume that Aiden also thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope based on Noah's claim.
Therefore, Owen thinks Noah thinks Aiden thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope.
