Answer: N. red_pantry

Explanation: In step 15, Benjamin privately told Abigail that the peach is in the red_pantry. Later, in step 41, Benjamin privately told Sophia that the plum is in the green_cupboard. Since Sophia trusts Benjamin (as he exited the room later than her), she would believe that Abigail thinks the peach is in the red_pantry, as Benjamin told her.
