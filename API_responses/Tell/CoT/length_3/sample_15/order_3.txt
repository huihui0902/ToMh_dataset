K. red_envelope

Explanation:
1. Aiden privately told Sophia that the peach is in the red_envelope (step 16).
2. Sophia has no other information about the peach's location after this interaction.
3. Therefore, Aiden thinks Sophia thinks the peach is in the red_envelope.
4. Abigail's thoughts are irrelevant in this case, as Aiden's belief about Sophia's thoughts is based on his own statement to her.
