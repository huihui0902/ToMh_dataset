K. red_envelope

Explanation:
1. Aiden privately told Sophia that the peach is in the red_envelope (step 16).
2. Isla knows about this private conversation because she was in the waiting_room with Aiden and Sophia (step 39).
3. Isla thinks Aiden thinks Sophia thinks the peach is in the red_envelope because that's what Aiden told Sophia.
4. Abigail's thoughts are not relevant in this case, as the question asks about Isla's belief about Aiden's belief about Sophia's belief.
