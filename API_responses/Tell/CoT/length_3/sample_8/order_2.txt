Answer: N. green_box

Explanation: Amelia was present in the garage when Chloe moved the carrot to the green_box (step 11). Amelia exited the garage before Chloe (step 8 vs step 12), so she has no reason to believe Chloe changed her mind about the carrot's location. Therefore, Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is in the green_box.
