Step 3: Avery hears Jack's public claim that the carrot is in the green_treasure_chest (line 18) and Jack privately tells Avery that the watermelon is in the blue_pantry (line 43). However, this information is about the watermelon, not the carrot. So, Avery believes the carrot is in the green_treasure_chest.

Step 7: Since Avery knows that Amelia exited the room later than himself, he trusts Amelia's belief. So, Avery thinks Amelia thinks the carrot is in the green_treasure_chest.
Step 8: Since Amelia knows that Chloe exited the room later than herself, she trusts Chloe's belief. So, Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is in the green_treasure_chest.
Step 9: However, Sophia privately told Jack that the carrot is in the green_box (line 19), and she still believes it. So, Sophia thinks Avery thinks Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is in the green_box (N).
