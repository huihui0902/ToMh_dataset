K. red_box

Sophia initially moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle (step 3). However, after re-entering the waiting_room, Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box (step 17). Since Jackson exited the front_yard later than Sophia, she would trust his information more, and therefore, she would believe that the sweet_potato is in the red_box.
