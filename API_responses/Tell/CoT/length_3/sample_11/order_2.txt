F. green_pantry

Explanation: In line 15, Jack publicly claimed that the spinach is in the green_pantry. Since Benjamin was present in the waiting_room with Jack, he heard this claim. Abigail was also present in the waiting_room, so Benjamin would think that Abigail heard the same claim and believes the spinach is in the green_pantry.
