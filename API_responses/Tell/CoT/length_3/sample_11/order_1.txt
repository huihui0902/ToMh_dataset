F. green_pantry

Abigail really thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry because Jack publicly claimed that spinach is in the green_pantry (line 15), and Abigail was present in the waiting_room when Jack made this claim (line 14). Since Abigail has no other information about the location of the spinach, she would believe Jack's claim.
