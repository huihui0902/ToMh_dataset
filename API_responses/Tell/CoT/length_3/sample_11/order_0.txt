F. green_pantry

Explanation: In line 2, it is stated that the spinach is in the green_pantry. Later, in line 12, Isla moved the spinach to the green_pantry, which confirms its location. Although Isla privately told Jack that the spinach is in the blue_suitcase (line 16), we should not trust this statement as agents tend to lie. The most reliable information is from the actions and movements, which indicate that the spinach is in the green_pantry.
