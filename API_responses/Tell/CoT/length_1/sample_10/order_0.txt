Answer: B. green_cupboard

Explanation: The potato's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the blue_bathtub (line 2). Then, Avery moved it to the blue_pantry (line 5), and finally, Jacob moved it to the green_cupboard (line 7). Since no other movements were made after that, the potato is really in the green_cupboard.
