A. blue_bathtub

Explanation: 
1. Carter was in the study and saw the potato in the blue_bathtub before exiting.
2. Avery moved the potato to the blue_pantry, but Carter didn't witness this.
3. Jacob moved the potato to the green_cupboard, but Carter didn't witness this either.
4. Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub, which is what Carter last saw.
5. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle, but this information is not relevant to Carter's belief.

Since Alexander knows that Jacob publicly claimed the potato is in the blue_bathtub, and Carter didn't witness any other movements, Alexander would think that Jacob thinks Carter believes the potato is in the blue_bathtub.
