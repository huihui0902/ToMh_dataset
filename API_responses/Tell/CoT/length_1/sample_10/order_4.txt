A. blue_bathtub

Explanation:
1. Carter thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub (line 2).
2. Avery and Jacob moved the potato, but Carter doesn't know this (lines 5 and 7).
3. Jackson entered the study after Carter, Avery, and Jacob, so he knows the potato's location (green_cupboard) and that Carter thinks it's in the blue_bathtub.
4. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute (line 11). He knows the potato's location (green_cupboard) and that Carter thinks it's in the blue_bathtub.
5. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle (line 15). This doesn't affect his actual belief, but Jackson doesn't know about this private communication.
6. Jackson thinks Alexander thinks Jacob thinks Carter thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub because that's the last known location for Carter, and there were no public claims or interactions to change that belief.
