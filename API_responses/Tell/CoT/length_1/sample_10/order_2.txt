A. blue_bathtub

Explanation: When Carter was in the study, the potato was in the blue_bathtub (line 2). Carter didn't make any movements and exited the study (lines 3-4). Jacob thinks Carter still believes the potato is in the blue_bathtub because Carter left the study before any of the other movements occurred (lines 5-12).
