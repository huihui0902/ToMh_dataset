K. green_treasure_chest

Explanation: The tangerine's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the green_treasure_chest (line 2). Benjamin moved it to the blue_pantry (line 10), but then Elizabeth moved it back to the green_treasure_chest (line 12). Since there were no more changes to its location, the tangerine is really in the green_treasure_chest.
