Answer: N. red_box

Explanation: 
1. Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box (Step 15). So, Mila thinks the tangerine is in the red_box.
2. Elizabeth was not present during this private conversation, but she knows Amelia exited the attic after Mila (Step 9). According to the assumption, an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than themselves. So, Elizabeth would think that Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is in the red_box.
