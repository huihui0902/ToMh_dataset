Answer: N. red_box

Explanation: 
- Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box (Step 15).
- Chloe exited the attic before Amelia (Step 6), so Chloe would trust Amelia's information.
- Chloe privately told Benjamin that the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest (Step 16), but this doesn't affect Chloe's actual belief.
- Therefore, Chloe thinks Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is in the red_box.
