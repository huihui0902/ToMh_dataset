E. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation:
1. Noah thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest because Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest (step 17).
2. Liam exited the garage before Avery and Lily (step 7), so he didn't witness Avery moving the lemon to the blue_pantry (step 8) or Lily moving it to the blue_bathtub (step 12).
3. Since Liam didn't witness these events, he would still believe the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest, which is what he told Noah.
4. Noah trusts Liam because Liam exited the garage later than Noah (step 11).
