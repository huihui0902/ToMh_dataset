E. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation:
Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest (step 17). Since Liam and Avery never had any interaction, Liam is not aware of what Avery thinks. Therefore, Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest, which is the information Liam has.
