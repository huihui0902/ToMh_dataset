A. blue_bathtub

Explanation: The lemon's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the blue_bathtub (2). Abigail moved it to the blue_treasure_chest (3), Avery moved it to the blue_pantry (8), and finally, Lily moved it back to the blue_bathtub (12). The private communications between the agents (16 and 17) are not accurate, as they are based on outdated information and the agents tend to lie. The lemon is really in the blue_bathtub.
