Answer: C. blue_pantry

Explanation: Avery moved the lemon to the blue_pantry in step 8 and then exited the garage in step 9. Since Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub in step 12 after Avery had already exited the garage, Avery is not aware of this change. Therefore, Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is still in the blue_pantry, where Avery last placed it.
