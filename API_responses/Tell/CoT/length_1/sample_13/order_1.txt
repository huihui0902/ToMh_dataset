A. red_crate

Owen thinks the onion is in the red_crate because he was the last person to move the onion, and he moved it to the red_crate (step 13). Since Owen exited the cellar after Elizabeth, he would not trust her claim that the onion is in the green_bucket (step 11). Additionally, Owen has not had any private or public interactions with other agents regarding the onion's location, so his belief remains unchanged.
