A. red_crate

Explanation: Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is in the red_crate because Jack privately told her that the onion is in the red_crate (step 17). Since Elizabeth exited the cellar before Owen (step 12), she would trust Owen's actions more than her own. However, she is not aware of Owen's action of moving the onion back to the red_crate (step 13) because she had already exited the cellar. Therefore, she believes the information Jack provided, which is that the onion is in the red_crate.
