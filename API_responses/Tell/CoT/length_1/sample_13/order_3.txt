A. red_crate

Explanation:
Step 1: Elizabeth moved the onion to the green_bucket and exited the cellar.
Step 2: Owen moved the onion back to the red_crate and exited the cellar.
Step 3: Liam privately told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket (Liam believes it's in the green_bucket).
Step 4: Jack privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the red_crate (Jack believes it's in the red_crate).

Since Liam trusts agents who exited the room later than himself, he would trust Owen's action. Therefore, Liam thinks Elizabeth knows that Owen moved the onion back to the red_crate. So, Liam thinks Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is in the red_crate.
