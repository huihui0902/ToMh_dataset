Answer: G. blue_crate

Explanation: Alexander initially saw the green_pepper in the blue_crate (line 2) and moved it to the blue_suitcase (line 3). However, he exited the den (line 4) before Evelyn moved the green_pepper to the blue_treasure_chest (line 5). Since Alexander did not witness this change, he still believes the green_pepper is in the blue_crate. Additionally, Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate (line 15), which aligns with his belief.
