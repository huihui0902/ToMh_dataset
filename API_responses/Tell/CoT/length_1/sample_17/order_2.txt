G. blue_crate

Explanation: Evelyn exited the den after Alexander, so she knows that Alexander moved the green_pepper to the blue_suitcase (step 3). However, Evelyn moved the green_pepper to the blue_treasure_chest (step 5) after Alexander left, so Alexander is not aware of this change. Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate (step 15), and since Alexander tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself, he believes Hannah. Therefore, Evelyn thinks Alexander thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_crate.
