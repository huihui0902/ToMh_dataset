G. blue_crate

Explanation:
Hannah thinks that Evelyn thinks that Alexander thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_crate. This is because Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate (step 15). Since Hannah and Evelyn have not had any private or public interactions regarding the green_pepper's location, Hannah would assume that Evelyn's knowledge is based on Alexander's knowledge, which Hannah believes is the blue_crate.
