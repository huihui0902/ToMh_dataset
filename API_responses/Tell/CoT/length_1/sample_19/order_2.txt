D. blue_crate

Explanation: Lily exited the den before Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate. Since Lily witnessed everything before exiting, she knows that the green_pepper was in the red_drawer. However, she also knows that Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate after she left. Therefore, Lily thinks Logan thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_crate.
