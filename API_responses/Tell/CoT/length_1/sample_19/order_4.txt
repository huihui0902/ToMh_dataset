D. blue_crate

Explanation:
1. Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate, so Logan thinks it's in the blue_crate.
2. Lily exited the den before Logan moved the green_pepper, so she doesn't know about the change. Lily thinks the green_pepper is still in the red_drawer.
3. Ella publicly claimed that the green_pepper is in the red_pantry, but this doesn't affect her actual belief. Since Ella exited the den after Lily but before Logan moved the green_pepper, she thinks it's in the red_drawer.
4. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green_pepper is in the red_drawer, but this doesn't affect her actual belief. Since Elizabeth exited the den after Logan moved the green_pepper, she knows it's in the blue_crate.
5. Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_crate because Elizabeth knows the actual location and knows that Ella and Lily exited the den before Logan moved the green_pepper.
