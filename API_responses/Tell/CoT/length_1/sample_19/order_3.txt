Answer: B. red_drawer

Explanation: Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green_pepper is in the red_drawer because:
1. Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate (step 9) and then exited the den (step 10).
2. Lily exited the den before Logan (step 6), so she didn't witness Logan moving the green_pepper.
3. Since Lily didn't witness Logan's action, she still believes the green_pepper is in the red_drawer (step 2).
4. Ella exited the den after Lily (step 8) but before Logan, so she also didn't witness Logan's action.
5. Ella can infer Lily's mental state since they were in the same location (the den) and knows that Lily didn't witness Logan's action.
6. Therefore, Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green_pepper is in the red_drawer.
