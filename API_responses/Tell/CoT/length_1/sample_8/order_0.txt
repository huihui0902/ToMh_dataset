K. red_bucket

Explanation: The story mentions the movements of the lettuce in the following order:
1. The lettuce is initially in the red_bucket (line 2).
2. Sophia moves the lettuce to the red_box (line 3).
3. Alexander moves the lettuce to the red_pantry (line 9).
4. Emily moves the lettuce back to the red_bucket (line 11).

Since Emily is the last person to move the lettuce, it is currently in the red_bucket.
