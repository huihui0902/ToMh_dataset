Answer: L. red_pantry

Explanation: Benjamin thinks Isla thinks the lettuce is in the red_pantry because Isla privately told Alexander that the lettuce is in the red_pantry. Since private communications are known to be heard only by the intended recipient, Benjamin would trust Isla's statement to Alexander, as Isla exited the living_room later than Benjamin.
