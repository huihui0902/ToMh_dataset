L. red_pantry

Isla really thinks the lettuce is in the red_pantry because she privately told Alexander that the lettuce is in the red_pantry. According to the given assumptions, what a character tells others doesn't affect their actual belief, and agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later than themselves. Since Isla exited the living_room before Alexander, she would trust Alexander's information more than her own. Alexander moved the lettuce to the red_pantry, so Isla would believe it is there.
