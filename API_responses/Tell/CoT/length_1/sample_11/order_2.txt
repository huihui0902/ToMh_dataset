I. green_envelope

Ava thinks Sophia thinks the pear is in the green_envelope because Ava moved the pear to the green_envelope in step 3 and then exited the lounge in step 4. Since Ava exited the lounge before Sophia, she has no knowledge of the subsequent movements of the pear or any private communications between other agents. Therefore, Ava's belief about Sophia's thoughts is based on her own last action, which was placing the pear in the green_envelope.
