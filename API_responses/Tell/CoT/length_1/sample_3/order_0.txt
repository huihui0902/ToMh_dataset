Explanation: The onion's location can be traced through the story. In step 2, the onion is in the green_crate. In step 3, Emily moves the onion to the blue_pantry. In step 5, Liam moves the onion to the red_drawer. No other movements of the onion are mentioned after this point. The private communications in steps 14 and 15 are likely lies, as agents tend to lie. Therefore, the onion is really in the red_drawer.
