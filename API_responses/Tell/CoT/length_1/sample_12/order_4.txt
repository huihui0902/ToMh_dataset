Answer: N. green_box

Explanation: 
- Owen saw the tangerine in the red_bottle before leaving the front_yard.
- Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box, so he knows it's in the green_box.
- Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red_basket, but she publicly claimed it's in the blue_crate.
- Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket, which is the truth.

Now, let's analyze the question step-by-step:
1. Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.
2. Logan exited the front_yard after Ava, so Ava would trust Logan's knowledge. Logan thinks the tangerine is in the green_box.
3. Owen exited the front_yard before Logan, so Logan would not trust Owen's knowledge. Therefore, Owen thinks Logan thinks the tangerine is in the green_box.
4. Elizabeth was in the same location as Owen and heard his public claim. She would trust Owen's knowledge since he exited the front_yard later than her. So, Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is in the green_box.
