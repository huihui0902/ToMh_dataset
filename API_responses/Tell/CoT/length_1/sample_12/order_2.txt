O. red_basket

Explanation: Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box (step 5) and then exited the front_yard (step 6). After that, Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red_basket (step 7) and exited the front_yard. Since Logan exited the front_yard before Elizabeth, he would trust her actions. Therefore, Logan would think that Ava, who entered the waiting_room after Elizabeth, would also trust Elizabeth's actions and believe that the tangerine is in the red_basket.
