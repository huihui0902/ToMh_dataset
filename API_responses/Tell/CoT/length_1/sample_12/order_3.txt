Answer: K. red_bottle

Explanation: Owen exited the front_yard after step 4, so he didn't see Logan move the tangerine to the green_box in step 5. Therefore, Owen thinks the tangerine is still in the red_bottle. Since Owen and Logan didn't have any interactions after that, Owen has no reason to believe that Logan's belief about the tangerine's location has changed. Thus, Owen thinks Logan thinks the tangerine is in the red_bottle. Similarly, Logan and Ava didn't have any interactions after Logan exited the front_yard, so Owen thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_bottle as well.
