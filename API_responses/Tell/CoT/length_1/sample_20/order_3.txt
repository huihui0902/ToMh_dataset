N. red_bottle

Explanation:
1. Liam moved the peach to the blue_treasure_chest (step 6) and then exited the patio.
2. Benjamin privately told Hannah that the peach is in the red_envelope (step 16), but this doesn't affect Liam's belief.
3. Liam privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle (step 17).
4. Benjamin exited the patio before Liam told Avery about the red_bottle (step 9), so Benjamin doesn't know about this conversation.
5. However, since agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later than themselves, Benjamin would trust Liam's information more than his own.
6. Therefore, Benjamin thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is in the red_bottle (choice N).
