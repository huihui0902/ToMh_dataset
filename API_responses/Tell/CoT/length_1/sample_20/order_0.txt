O. blue_treasure_chest

The peach is in the blue_treasure_chest because Liam moved it there in step 6. The other statements about the peach's location (red_envelope and red_bottle) are private communications and are likely lies, as agents tend to lie. Since Liam was the last one to interact with the peach before exiting the patio, his action of moving it to the blue_treasure_chest is the most reliable information.
