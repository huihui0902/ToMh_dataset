B. green_envelope

Explanation: Carter exited the sunroom after William, so he knows that William moved the watermelon to the green_basket (step 9). However, Carter is not aware of the private conversation between Jacob and William (step 16), where Jacob told William that the watermelon is in the green_envelope. Since Carter has no knowledge of this conversation, he would still think that William believes the watermelon is in the green_basket. But according to the assumption (3) that every agent tends to lie, Carter would believe that William thinks the watermelon is in the green_envelope, as told by Jacob.
