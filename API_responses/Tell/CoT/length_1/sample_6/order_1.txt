B. green_envelope

Explanation: William thinks the watermelon is in the green_envelope because Jacob privately told him so in step 16. According to the assumptions, William trusts Jacob's information since Jacob exited the sunroom later than William (step 6 vs step 10). Additionally, William is unaware of Emma's private communication with Owen, so he has no reason to believe the watermelon is in any other location.
