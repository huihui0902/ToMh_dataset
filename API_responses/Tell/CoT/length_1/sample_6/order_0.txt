C. green_basket

Explanation: Following the story step-by-step, we can see that the watermelon was moved to different locations by different people. The last person to move the watermelon was William, who moved it to the green_basket (step 9) before exiting the sunroom. Since no one else moved the watermelon after William, it is still in the green_basket.
