B. green_envelope

Explanation:
1. Emma thinks Owen thinks the watermelon is in the green_bucket because she privately told him so in step 15.
2. Owen exited the sunroom before Carter, so Carter would trust William's information more than Owen's. Therefore, Carter would think the watermelon is in the green_envelope, as Jacob privately told William in step 16.
3. Since William exited the sunroom after Carter, Emma would think that Owen believes Carter trusts William's information.
4. Therefore, Emma thinks Owen thinks Carter thinks William thinks the watermelon is in the green_envelope.
