B. green_envelope

Explanation:
Owen thinks Carter thinks William thinks the watermelon is in the green_envelope because of the following reasons:

1. Owen exited the sunroom first, so he didn't witness any movements after he left. He last saw the watermelon in the green_envelope.
2. Carter stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute and exited after everyone else. He witnessed all the movements, so he knows the watermelon is in the green_basket.
3. William was told by Jacob privately that the watermelon is in the green_envelope. Since private communications are not heard by others, Carter doesn't know about this conversation.
4. Owen knows that Carter exited the sunroom after William, so he assumes that Carter trusts William's knowledge more than his own.
5. Since Owen doesn't know about the private conversation between Jacob and William, he thinks Carter believes William thinks the watermelon is in the green_envelope, which is where Owen last saw it.
