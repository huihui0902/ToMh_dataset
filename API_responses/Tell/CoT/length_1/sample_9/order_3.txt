Explanation: 
1. Abigail saw the spinach in the blue_suitcase and then exited the laundry.
2. Owen moved the spinach to the red_basket and exited the laundry. Owen thinks Abigail believes the spinach is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Amelia and Jack entered and exited the laundry, but their actions don't affect Owen's belief.
4. Aiden moved the spinach back to the blue_suitcase and exited the laundry. Aiden thinks Owen believes Abigail thinks the spinach is in the blue_suitcase.
5. Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red_container, but this doesn't affect Aiden's belief about Owen's belief.
6. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue_suitcase, but this doesn't affect Aiden's belief about Owen's belief.
