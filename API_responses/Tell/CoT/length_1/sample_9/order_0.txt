F. blue_suitcase

Explanation: The spinach's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the blue_suitcase (line 2). Owen moved it to the red_basket (line 5), Jack moved it to the green_pantry (line 9), and finally, Aiden moved it back to the blue_suitcase (line 12). Since Aiden was the last person to move the spinach and there were no more changes mentioned, the spinach is really in the blue_suitcase.
