H. red_container

Abigail exited the laundry before Owen moved the spinach to the red_basket, so she didn't witness that change. She also didn't witness the subsequent moves by Jack and Aiden. When they all entered the waiting_room, Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red_container. Since Abigail tends to trust agents who exited the room later than herself, she would believe Amelia's claim that the spinach is in the red_container.
