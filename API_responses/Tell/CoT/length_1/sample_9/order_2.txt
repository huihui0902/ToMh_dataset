G. red_basket

Explanation:
When Owen exited the laundry, he had moved the spinach to the red_basket (step 5). Since Abigail exited the laundry before Owen moved the spinach, Owen would think that Abigail still believes the spinach is in the blue_suitcase. However, Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red_container (step 15), and since agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, Owen would think that Abigail now believes the spinach is in the red_container. But since Owen knows the actual location of the spinach when he left the laundry, he would think that Abigail thinks the spinach is in the red_basket, which is the closest option to the red_container.
