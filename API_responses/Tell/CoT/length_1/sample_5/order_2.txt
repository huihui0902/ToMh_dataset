N. red_crate

Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is in the red_crate because she publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate (line 16). Since there was no public interaction between Logan and Sophia regarding the location of the asparagus, Sophia has no reason to believe that Logan thinks differently. Additionally, Logan privately told Hannah about the blue_drawer (line 17), but Sophia is not aware of this private communication.
