N. red_crate

Explanation: 
Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is in the red_crate because Sophia publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate (step 16). Since Elizabeth and Sophia were in the same location (waiting_room) and this was a public claim, Elizabeth would be aware of Sophia's claim. Additionally, Elizabeth exited the garage before Logan, so she would not be aware of Logan's private communication with Hannah (step 17).
