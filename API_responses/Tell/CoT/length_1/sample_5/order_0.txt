L. blue_drawer

The asparagus is in the blue_drawer, as mentioned in line 3 of the story. Sophia publicly claimed that it is in the red_crate (line 16), but this is likely a lie since agents tend to lie. Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer (line 17), which matches the information given in line 3.
