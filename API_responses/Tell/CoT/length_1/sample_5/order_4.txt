Answer: N. red_crate

Explanation: 
Step 1: Sophia publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate (line 16). 
Step 2: Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer (line 17). 
Step 3: Since Hannah trusts Logan more (as he exited the garage later), she believes the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. 
Step 4: However, Elizabeth doesn't know about the private conversation between Logan and Hannah. She only knows about Sophia's public claim. 
Step 5: So, Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks the asparagus is in the red_crate. 
Step 6: Hannah knows that Elizabeth was present when Sophia made the public claim, so she thinks Elizabeth believes Sophia's claim. 
Step 7: Therefore, Hannah thinks Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is in the red_crate (N).
