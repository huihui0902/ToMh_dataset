Answer: K. green_bottle

Explanation: When Amelia exited the cellar, the tangerine was in the green_bottle (moved by Sophia). Since Amelia made no movements and witnessed Sophia's action, she would believe the tangerine is in the green_bottle. Ava was in the same location as Amelia (the waiting_room) and had no private or public interactions with her that would change her belief about Amelia's mental state. Therefore, Ava thinks Amelia believes the tangerine is in the green_bottle.
