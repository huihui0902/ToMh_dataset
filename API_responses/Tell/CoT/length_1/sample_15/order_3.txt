Answer: K. green_bottle

Explanation: 
1. Amelia exited the cellar after Sophia, so Amelia would think the tangerine is in the green_bottle (as per step 5).
2. Ava had a private conversation with Carter, so Carter knows that Ava is aware of his belief. Since Carter exited the cellar after Amelia, Ava would trust Carter's information more and think that Amelia thinks the tangerine is in the green_bottle.
3. Therefore, Carter thinks Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is in the green_bottle.
