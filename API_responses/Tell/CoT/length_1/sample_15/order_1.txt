Answer: K. green_bottle

Explanation: Amelia entered the cellar after Sophia and before Abigail. When Amelia was in the cellar, the tangerine was in the green_bottle (as per step 5). Since Amelia made no movements and exited the cellar before Abigail moved the tangerine to the red_crate (step 9), Amelia would still believe the tangerine is in the green_bottle.
