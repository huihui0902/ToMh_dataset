A. green_envelope

Explanation:
1. Jack exited the hall after Noah moved the carrot to the green_envelope, so Jack thinks the carrot is in the green_envelope.
2. William exited the hall before Noah moved the carrot, so Jack thinks William thinks the carrot is in the red_basket.
3. Hannah exited the hall after moving the carrot back to the red_basket, but she privately told Charlotte that the carrot is in the blue_container. Since Jack was not part of this private conversation, he is not aware of it.
4. Therefore, Jack thinks Hannah thinks William thinks the carrot is in the green_envelope, as that is the last known location of the carrot before Jack exited the hall.
