B. red_basket

Explanation: William exited the hall after step 5, before Noah moved the carrot to the green_envelope (step 12) and Hannah moved it back to the red_basket (step 14). Since William did not witness these events, he would still believe the carrot is in the red_basket. Additionally, he did not hear Hannah's private communication with Charlotte (step 18), so he has no reason to think the carrot is in the blue_container.
