Answer: A. green_envelope

Explanation: Hannah thinks William thinks the carrot is in the green_envelope because Charlotte publicly claimed that the carrot is in the green_envelope (step 17). William exited the hall before Noah moved the carrot to the green_envelope (step 13) and before Hannah moved it back to the red_basket (step 14). Since William has no other information about the carrot's location after he exited the hall, Hannah would assume that William believes Charlotte's public claim.
