B. red_basket

Explanation: In the story, Noah moved the carrot to the green_envelope (line 12), but then Hannah moved the carrot to the red_basket (line 14) before exiting the hall. Since Hannah was the last person to move the carrot and no other movements were mentioned, the carrot is really in the red_basket. Charlotte's public claim (line 17) and Hannah's private statement (line 18) are assumed to be lies based on the given information that agents tend to lie.
