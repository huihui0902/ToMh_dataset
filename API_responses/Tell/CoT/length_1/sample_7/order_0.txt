N. green_drawer

Explanation: In step 9, Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer. Since no one else made any movements or changed the location of the tomato after Liam, the tomato is still in the green_drawer. Carter privately told Emma the correct location in step 17, but Nathan's public claim in step 16 was incorrect.
