Answer: L. red_container

Explanation: 
1. Emma saw the tomato in the red_container (line 3) and then exited the study (line 5).
2. Hannah entered the study after Emma and made no movements (line 6). She didn't witness the tomato being moved, so she still believes it's in the red_container.
3. Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer (line 9) and then exited the study. Hannah doesn't know this because she exited the study before Liam.
4. Nathan and Carter's claims (lines 16 and 17) don't affect Hannah's belief because she hasn't interacted with them after they exited the study.
5. Since Hannah believes the tomato is in the red_container, she would think that Liam also believes it's in the red_container, as she is unaware of his actions.
6. Therefore, Hannah thinks Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is in the red_container.
