N. green_drawer

Explanation:
1. Emma saw the tomato in the red_container (step 3) and then exited the study (step 5).
2. Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer (step 9) and then exited the study (step 10).
3. Carter heard Nathan's public claim that the tomato is in the blue_bottle (step 16), but he privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer (step 17). Since Carter exited the study after Liam, he trusts Liam's action and believes the tomato is in the green_drawer.
4. Hannah has no information about the tomato's location after she exited the study (step 7), so she would still think it's in the red_container.
5. Since Emma and Carter had a private conversation, Hannah is not aware of it. Therefore, Hannah would think that Liam thinks Emma still believes the tomato is in the red_container.
6. However, Carter knows that he told Emma about the green_drawer, so he thinks Hannah thinks Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is in the green_drawer.
