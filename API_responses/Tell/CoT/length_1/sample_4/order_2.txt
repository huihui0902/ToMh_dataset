L. green_bucket

Explanation: Benjamin thinks Jackson thinks the cherry is in the green_bucket because Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket. Since Benjamin and Jackson were in the same location (the master_bedroom), Benjamin can infer Jackson's mental state. Additionally, Benjamin tends to trust Jackson because Jackson exited the room later than Benjamin.
