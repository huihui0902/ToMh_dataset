L. green_bucket

Explanation: In the story, it is mentioned that "The cherry is in the green_bucket" (line 2). All the characters entered the master_bedroom and made no movements, which means they witnessed the cherry in the green_bucket. Although Avery told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate (line 14), and Jackson told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket (line 15), we should assume that every agent tends to lie. However, since the initial statement (line 2) is not a statement made by any of the agents, we can trust that the cherry is indeed in the green_bucket.
