D. red_box

Explanation:
1. Logan moved the cabbage to the green_pantry and then exited the master_bedroom.
2. Nathan moved the cabbage to the red_box and then exited the master_bedroom.
3. William exited the master_bedroom after Nathan, so Logan would think that Aiden thinks Nathan thinks William knows the cabbage is in the red_box.
4. Since Logan trusts Aiden, who exited the room later than himself, Logan would think Aiden thinks Nathan thinks William thinks the cabbage is in the red_box.
