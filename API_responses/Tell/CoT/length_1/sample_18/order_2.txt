D. red_box

Explanation: Nathan thinks William thinks the cabbage is in the red_box because Nathan was the last person to move the cabbage before exiting the master_bedroom. Nathan moved the cabbage to the red_box in step 7 and then exited the master_bedroom in step 8. Since William exited the master_bedroom in step 14, he did not witness any further movements of the cabbage. Therefore, Nathan would assume that William believes the cabbage is still in the red_box.
