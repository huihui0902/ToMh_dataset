Answer: L. blue_pantry

Explanation: 
1. Nathan was the last person to move the pear, and he moved it to the blue_pantry (step 13).
2. Owen has no knowledge of any private conversations or claims made after he exited the sunroom (step 6).
3. Owen knows that Nathan was the last person to exit the sunroom (step 15), so he trusts Nathan's action.
4. Therefore, Owen thinks Isabella thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is in the blue_pantry.
