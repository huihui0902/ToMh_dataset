Answer: L. blue_pantry

Explanation: 
Step 1: Nathan moved the pear to the blue_pantry (line 13) and then exited the sunroom (line 15).
Step 2: Amelia, Isabella, and Nathan entered the study (line 17). Since Amelia and Isabella were in the same location as Nathan, they can infer his mental state.
Step 3: Amelia publicly claimed that the cherry is in the red_envelope (line 26). This doesn't affect her belief about the pear's location.
Step 4: Isabella privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_crate (line 27). This doesn't affect her belief about the pear's location either.

Since Amelia and Isabella were in the same location as Nathan and can infer his mental state, they know that Nathan thinks the pear is in the blue_pantry. Isabella thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is in the blue_pantry.
