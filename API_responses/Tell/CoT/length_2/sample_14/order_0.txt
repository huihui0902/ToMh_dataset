L. blue_pantry

Explanation: The pear's location changed multiple times throughout the story. Initially, it was in the blue_pantry (line 2). Amelia moved it to the green_bucket (line 8), Aiden moved it to the blue_suitcase (line 10), and finally, Nathan moved it back to the blue_pantry (line 13). Since no other movements of the pear are mentioned after this, the pear is really in the blue_pantry.
