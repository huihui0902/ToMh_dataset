A. green_pantry

Explanation: Isla was the last person to move the lettuce in the living_room, and she moved it to the green_pantry (step 11). Since there is no further information about the lettuce's location or any interaction between Isla and other agents regarding the lettuce, we can assume that Isla really thinks the lettuce is in the green_pantry.
