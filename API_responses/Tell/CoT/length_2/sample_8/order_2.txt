A. green_pantry

Explanation: Charlotte exited the living_room after moving the lettuce to the blue_bathtub (step 8). She did not witness Aiden and Isla's actions. However, when all five characters entered the waiting_room (step 13), Charlotte could infer that Isla, who exited the living_room last, would know the latest location of the lettuce. Since Isla moved the lettuce to the green_pantry (step 11), Charlotte would think that Isla thinks the lettuce is in the green_pantry.
