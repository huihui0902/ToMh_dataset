D. green_bottle

Explanation:
Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle (step 7) and then exited the den (step 8). Evelyn entered the den after Jack and made no movements (step 9), so she would have seen the apple in the green_bottle. Ella and Evelyn were in the same location (the sunroom) and had a private interaction (step 25), so Ella can infer Evelyn's mental state. Therefore, Ella thinks Evelyn thinks Jack thinks the apple is in the green_bottle.
