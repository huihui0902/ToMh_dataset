D. green_bottle

Explanation:
1. Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle (step 7), and he exited the den (step 8).
2. Evelyn didn't make any movements and exited the den after Jack (step 10). So, Evelyn thinks the apple is in the green_bottle.
3. Ella, Amelia, and Evelyn were together in the sunroom (step 14) and waiting_room (step 23). Amelia knows that Evelyn exited the den after Jack, so Amelia thinks that Ella thinks Evelyn thinks the apple is in the green_bottle.
4. Since Amelia has no reason to doubt Ella's belief about Evelyn's belief, Amelia thinks Ella thinks Evelyn thinks Jack thinks the apple is in the green_bottle.
