D. green_bottle

Explanation: Evelyn was in the den when Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle (step 7). Since Evelyn has not had any interaction with Jack after that, she has no reason to believe that Jack's knowledge about the apple's location has changed. Therefore, Evelyn thinks Jack thinks the apple is in the green_bottle.
