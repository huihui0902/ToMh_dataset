B. red_basket

Explanation:
Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_basket in step 7 and then exited the workshop. Since Benjamin exited the workshop before Charlotte moved the cucumber, he would not have witnessed this action. However, Charlotte would know that Benjamin last saw the cucumber in the red_container (step 5). Since agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, Charlotte would believe that Benjamin thinks the cucumber is in the red_basket, as that is where she moved it after he left.
