B. red_basket

Explanation:
1. Benjamin moved the cucumber to the red_container (step 5) and then exited the workshop (step 6).
2. Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_basket (step 7) and then exited the workshop (step 8).
3. Isla, Ava, and Evelyn did not move the cucumber and exited the workshop later (steps 9-14).
4. Evelyn privately told Benjamin that the orange is in the green_bucket (step 28), but this information is not related to the cucumber's location.
5. Charlotte publicly claimed that the orange is in the green_bottle (step 26), but this information is also not related to the cucumber's location.

Since Charlotte was the last person to move the cucumber, and she moved it to the red_basket, Evelyn would think that Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks the cucumber is in the red_basket.
