B. red_basket

Explanation: Benjamin moved the cucumber to the red_container (step 5) and then exited the workshop (step 6). After he left, Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_basket (step 7). Since Benjamin witnessed everything before exiting the workshop, he would know that the cucumber was in the red_container when he left. However, since Charlotte exited the workshop later than Benjamin (step 8), and agents tend to trust agents who exited the room later than themselves, Benjamin would believe Charlotte's action and think the cucumber is in the red_basket.
