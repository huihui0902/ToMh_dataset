J. green_crate

Ella thinks Owen thinks the cherry is in the green_crate because Chloe privately told Owen that the apple is in the green_crate. Since Ella publicly claimed that the apple is in the blue_container, she would assume that Owen would not trust her claim due to the exit order rule. Therefore, Ella would think that Owen trusts Chloe's private information more and believes the cherry is in the green_crate.
