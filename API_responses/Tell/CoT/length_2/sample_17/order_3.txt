Answer: K. green_bucket

Explanation: 
1. Abigail knows that Owen moved the cherry to the green_bucket (step 5) because she was in the staircase at that time.
2. Abigail knows that Ella was in the staircase when Owen moved the cherry to the green_bucket (step 9).
3. Abigail knows that Owen exited the staircase after moving the cherry (step 6), so she would assume that Ella would trust Owen's knowledge about the cherry's location.
4. Therefore, Abigail thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks the cherry is in the green_bucket.
