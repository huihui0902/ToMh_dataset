O. blue_crate

Explanation: The onion's location changed multiple times throughout the story. The last time it was moved was in line 17, when Isabella moved the onion to the blue_crate. Although Isabella publicly claimed that the onion is in the green_cupboard (line 25), we should not trust this statement as agents tend to lie. Owen privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_crate (line 26), which matches the last known location from line 17. Therefore, the onion is really in the blue_crate.
