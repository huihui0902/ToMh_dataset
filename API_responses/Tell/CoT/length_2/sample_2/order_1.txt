O. blue_crate

Owen really thinks the onion is in the blue_crate because he privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_crate (line 26). Although Isabella publicly claimed that the onion is in the green_cupboard (line 25), Owen would not change his belief based on this information, as agents tend to lie and he exited the porch after Isabella (lines 18 and 23).
