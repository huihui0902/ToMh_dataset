O. blue_crate

Explanation: In step 26, Owen privately told Emily that the onion is in the blue_crate. Since Isabella was not present during this private conversation, she is not aware of what Owen told Emily. However, in step 25, Isabella publicly claimed that the onion is in the green_cupboard. Since public claims can be heard by everyone, including Emily, Isabella would think that Emily believes Owen thinks the onion is in the green_cupboard. However, we must consider that agents tend to lie and trust agents who exited the room later than themselves. Since Owen exited the porch after Isabella (step 23 vs step 18), Emily would trust Owen's statement more than Isabella's. Therefore, Isabella would think that Emily believes Owen's statement about the onion being in the blue_crate.
