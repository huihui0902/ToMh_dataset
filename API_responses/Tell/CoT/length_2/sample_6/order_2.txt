L. red_basket

Explanation:
Isabella exited the basement before William moved the peach to the green_bathtub and before Elizabeth moved it back to the red_basket. Therefore, Isabella's last known location of the peach is in the red_basket. Since Chloe made no movements and exited the basement before Isabella, Isabella would think that Chloe also believes the peach is in the red_basket.
