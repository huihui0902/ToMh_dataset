L. red_basket

Explanation:
1. Nathan and Isabella both exited the basement before William moved the peach to the green_bathtub (steps 4 and 6). So, they both think the peach is still in the red_basket.
2. Chloe exited the basement before Elizabeth moved the peach back to the red_basket (step 10). So, Chloe thinks the peach is in the green_bathtub.
3. Since Nathan and Isabella have not interacted with Chloe after she exited the basement, they cannot infer her mental state. Therefore, Nathan thinks Isabella thinks Chloe thinks the peach is in the red_basket, which is their last known location for the peach.
