L. red_basket

Explanation:
1. Chloe exited the basement before Elizabeth moved the peach to the red_basket, so Chloe thinks the peach is in the green_bathtub.
2. Isabella exited the basement before William moved the peach to the green_bathtub, so she thinks the peach is in the red_basket.
3. Nathan exited the basement before any peach movements, so he thinks the peach is in the red_basket.
4. William knows Nathan exited before any peach movements, so he thinks Nathan thinks the peach is in the red_basket.
5. William knows Isabella exited before he moved the peach, so he thinks Isabella thinks the peach is in the red_basket.
6. William knows Chloe exited before Elizabeth moved the peach, so he thinks Chloe thinks the peach is in the green_bathtub.

However, since agents tend to lie, we should consider the last truthful information William has about the peach's location. In this case, it is when Isabella exited the basement, thinking the peach is in the red_basket. So, William thinks Nathan thinks Isabella thinks Chloe thinks the peach is in the red_basket (L).
