Answer: O. red_crate

Explanation: Liam was in the cellar when the sweet_potato was in the red_drawer (step 2). He exited the cellar and didn't witness Mila moving the sweet_potato to the red_crate (step 9). When Liam re-entered the cellar (step 14), the sweet_potato was in the red_crate (step 15). Liam didn't witness Mila moving the sweet_potato to the red_container (step 18) and didn't hear any private or public interactions about the sweet_potato's location. Therefore, Liam really thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_crate.
