L. red_drawer

Explanation:
Hannah exited the cellar after step 6, before Mila moved the sweet_potato from the red_drawer to the red_crate in step 9. Since Hannah has not re-entered the cellar or had any private or public interactions with Mila or Evelyn, she still believes the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer. Liam also exited the cellar before Mila moved the sweet_potato, so Hannah would think that Liam also believes the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer.
