Answer: L. red_drawer

Explanation: 
Step 1: Liam, Hannah, and Emma all exit the cellar before Mila moves the sweet_potato. So, they all think the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer.
Step 2: Evelyn exits the cellar after Mila moves the sweet_potato to the red_crate, but she doesn't witness this action. So, she also thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer.
Step 3: Mila moves the sweet_potato to the red_container, but no one else witnesses this action.
Step 4: Mila publicly claims the sweet_potato is in the blue_container, but this doesn't affect her actual belief or the beliefs of others since they know agents tend to lie.
Step 5: Evelyn privately tells Mila that the sweet_potato is in the blue_suitcase, but this doesn't affect her actual belief or Mila's belief since they know agents tend to lie.

Since Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer, she would also think that Hannah thinks Liam thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer.
