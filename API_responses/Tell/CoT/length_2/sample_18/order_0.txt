M. red_container

Explanation:
Initially, the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer (line 2). Mila moves it to the red_crate (line 9). Later, Mila moves it again to the red_container (line 18). Mila's public claim (line 23) and Evelyn's private statement (line 24) are both lies, as they are known to lie. Therefore, the sweet_potato is really in the red_container.
