L. red_drawer

Explanation:
1. Liam thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer (line 2) because he didn't see any movements before he exited the cellar (line 4).
2. Hannah also thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer because she didn't see any movements before she exited the cellar (line 6).
3. Emma thinks Hannah thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer because they both exited the cellar without seeing any movements (lines 6 and 8).
4. Evelyn didn't interact with Emma, so Emma has no information about Evelyn's thoughts.
5. Therefore, Emma thinks Evelyn thinks Hannah thinks Liam thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_drawer.
