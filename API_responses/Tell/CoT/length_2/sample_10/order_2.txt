M. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
Evelyn moved the persimmon to the blue_cupboard in step 7 and then exited the bathroom. Since Ava exited the bathroom before Evelyn moved the persimmon, Evelyn would think that Ava is unaware of the persimmon's current location. However, Evelyn knows that Charlotte moved the persimmon to the red_crate in step 5. So, Evelyn would think that Ava thinks the persimmon is in the blue_crate. But since Evelyn moved the persimmon to the blue_cupboard, she would think that Ava thinks the persimmon is in the blue_cupboard.
