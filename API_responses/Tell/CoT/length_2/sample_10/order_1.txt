Answer: L. blue_crate

Explanation: Ava exited the bathroom after step 4, before any of the other characters moved the persimmon. At that time, the persimmon was in the blue_crate (step 2). Since Ava did not witness any of the subsequent movements of the persimmon and did not have any private or public interactions about its location, she still believes it is in the blue_crate.
