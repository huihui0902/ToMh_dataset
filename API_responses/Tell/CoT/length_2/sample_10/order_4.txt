Answer: M. blue_cupboard

Explanation: 
1. Benjamin thinks Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is in the blue_cupboard because:
2. Benjamin knows that Charlotte moved the persimmon to the red_crate (step 5) and exited the bathroom.
3. Benjamin also knows that Evelyn moved the persimmon to the blue_cupboard (step 7) and exited the bathroom.
4. Since Benjamin exited the bathroom after Charlotte and Evelyn, he would trust Evelyn's action more than Charlotte's.
5. Therefore, Benjamin thinks Charlotte would also trust Evelyn's action more than her own, and thus, he believes Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is in the blue_cupboard.
