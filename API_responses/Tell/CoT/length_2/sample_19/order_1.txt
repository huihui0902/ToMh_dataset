Answer: J. blue_suitcase

Explanation: Benjamin entered the pantry after Noah moved the carrot to the blue_suitcase (step 3) and before Emily moved it to the blue_drawer (step 9). Since Benjamin made no movements during his time in the pantry and did not witness Emily's action, he would still believe the carrot is in the blue_suitcase.
