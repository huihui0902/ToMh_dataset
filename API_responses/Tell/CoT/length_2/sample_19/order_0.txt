I. blue_drawer

Explanation: In step 3, Noah moved the carrot from the green_treasure_chest to the blue_suitcase. Then, in step 9, Emily moved the carrot from the blue_suitcase to the blue_drawer. No other movements of the carrot were mentioned in the story, so the carrot is really in the blue_drawer.
