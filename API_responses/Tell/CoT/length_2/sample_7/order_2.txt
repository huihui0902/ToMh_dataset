Answer: A. green_cupboard

Explanation: Emily has no information about Aiden's thoughts on the asparagus, as they never had any interaction regarding it. The only information about the asparagus in the story is in lines 2 and 4. Since Aiden did not witness Hannah moving the asparagus to the green_treasure_chest (line 4), Emily would assume that Aiden still thinks the asparagus is in the green_cupboard (line 2).
