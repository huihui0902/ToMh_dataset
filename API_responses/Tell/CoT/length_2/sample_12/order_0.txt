L. green_envelope

Explanation: The spinach was initially in the green_envelope (line 3). Mila moved it to the blue_container (line 4). However, Jackson later moved the spinach back to the green_envelope (line 12). No other movements of the spinach are mentioned in the story, so it remains in the green_envelope.
