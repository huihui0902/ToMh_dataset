Answer: L. green_envelope

Explanation: 
1. Isabella thinks Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is in the green_envelope because of the following reasons:
2. Jackson moved the spinach to the green_envelope (step 12) before exiting the kitchen.
3. Avery did not witness Jackson's action (step 12) because she had already exited the kitchen (step 9).
4. Therefore, Avery's last known location of the spinach is in the blue_container (step 4).
5. Jackson witnessed Avery's exit (step 9) and knows that she did not see him move the spinach to the green_envelope (step 12).
6. Isabella knows that Jackson exited the kitchen after Avery (step 13) and can infer that Jackson knows what Avery thinks about the spinach's location.
7. Since Isabella trusts Jackson more than Avery (due to exit order), she believes that Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is in the green_envelope.
