L. green_envelope

Explanation:
Jackson moved the spinach to the green_envelope in step 12. Since Avery made no movements related to the spinach and had no private or public interactions with anyone about the spinach, Jackson would think that Avery still believes the spinach is in the green_envelope, as it was before Jackson moved it.
