Answer: B. red_crate

Explanation: 
1. Liam thinks the grapes are in the blue_suitcase because he saw Benjamin move them there and then exited the workshop.
2. Elizabeth entered the workshop after Liam, so she would think Liam thinks the grapes are in the blue_suitcase.
3. Alexander entered the workshop after Elizabeth, so he would think Elizabeth thinks Liam thinks the grapes are in the blue_suitcase. However, Alexander moved the grapes to the red_crate before exiting the workshop, so he would think Elizabeth thinks Liam thinks the grapes are in the red_crate.
4. Benjamin would not know about the grapes being moved to the red_crate, so his thoughts are irrelevant to Alexander's belief about Elizabeth's thoughts about Liam's thoughts.
