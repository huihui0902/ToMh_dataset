A. blue_pantry

Explanation: The grapes were initially in the blue_pantry (line 2). Benjamin moved them to the blue_suitcase (line 3), then Alexander moved them to the red_crate (line 11). Finally, Owen moved the grapes back to the blue_pantry (line 13). No further movements of the grapes were mentioned, so they are in the blue_pantry.
