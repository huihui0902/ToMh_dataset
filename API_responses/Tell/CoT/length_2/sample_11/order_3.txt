Answer: E. blue_suitcase

Explanation: 
1. Elizabeth knows that Benjamin moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase (step 3) before he exited the workshop.
2. Elizabeth has no information about any further movements of the grapes since she exited the workshop before Alexander and Owen made their moves (steps 11 and 13).
3. Elizabeth has not been in the same location as Liam after the workshop, so she has no information about Liam's thoughts.
4. Therefore, Elizabeth thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the grapes are in the blue_suitcase, as that was the last known location of the grapes when Elizabeth and Liam were in the workshop.
