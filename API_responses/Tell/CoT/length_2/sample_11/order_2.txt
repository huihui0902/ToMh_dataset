Answer: E. blue_suitcase

Explanation: Liam exited the workshop after Benjamin moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase (step 6). Since Liam has not been in the same location as Benjamin after that, he has no reason to believe that Benjamin's thoughts about the grapes' location have changed. Therefore, Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the grapes are in the blue_suitcase.
