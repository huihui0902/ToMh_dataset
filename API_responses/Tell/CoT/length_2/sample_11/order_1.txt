A. blue_pantry

Explanation: In step 3, Benjamin moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase. However, in step 11, Alexander moved the grapes to the red_crate, and in step 13, Owen moved the grapes back to the blue_pantry. Since Benjamin was not present in the workshop during these events, he would not have witnessed these movements. However, in step 29, Owen privately told Benjamin that the watermelon is in the red_pantry. Since they were in the same location and had a private interaction, Benjamin would trust Owen's information. Therefore, Benjamin really thinks the grapes are in the blue_pantry.
