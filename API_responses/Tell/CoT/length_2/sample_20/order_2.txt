A. green_bottle

Lily thinks Jacob thinks the melon is in the green_bottle because when Lily last saw the melon, it was in the blue_treasure_chest (step 4). After Lily exited the garden, Amelia, Jacob, and Evelyn moved the melon to different locations (steps 5, 7, and 9). Since Lily has not been in the same location as Amelia and Evelyn, she cannot infer their mental states. However, Lily has been in the same location as Jacob (steps 13 and 15), so she can infer Jacob's mental state. Jacob moved the melon to the green_drawer (step 7), but Evelyn moved it to the green_bottle after Jacob exited the garden (step 9). Since Jacob exited the garden before Evelyn, Lily would assume that Jacob thinks the melon is still in the green_bottle.
