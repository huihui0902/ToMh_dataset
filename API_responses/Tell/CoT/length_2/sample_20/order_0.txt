B. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation:
The melon's location changes as follows:
1. Blue_treasure_chest (line 2)
2. Green_bucket (line 5)
3. Green_drawer (line 7)
4. Green_bottle (line 9)
5. Blue_treasure_chest (line 11)

Since there are no more movements of the melon after line 11, the melon is really in the blue_treasure_chest.
