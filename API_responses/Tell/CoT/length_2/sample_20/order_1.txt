B. blue_treasure_chest

Explanation: Jacob was the last person to interact with the melon before Ava moved it back to the blue_treasure_chest. Since Jacob has not been in the same location as Ava or had any private or public interactions with her, he has no way of knowing that the melon was moved back to the blue_treasure_chest. Therefore, Jacob really thinks the melon is in the green_drawer, where he left it. However, since every agent tends to lie, Jacob would claim the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest.
