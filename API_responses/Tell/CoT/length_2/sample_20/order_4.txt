A. green_bottle

Explanation:
1. Jacob thinks the melon is in the green_bottle because that's where he left it (step 9).
2. Lily exited the garden before Jacob moved the melon, so she thinks the melon is still in the blue_treasure_chest (step 4).
3. Evelyn knows that Lily thinks the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest because she was in the garden when Lily exited (step 10).
4. Ava knows that Evelyn thinks Lily thinks the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest because she was in the garden when Evelyn exited (step 12).
5. However, Ava moved the melon to the blue_treasure_chest after Evelyn exited the garden (step 11). So, Ava thinks Evelyn thinks Lily thinks Jacob thinks the melon is in the green_bottle, which is where Evelyn left it (step 9).
