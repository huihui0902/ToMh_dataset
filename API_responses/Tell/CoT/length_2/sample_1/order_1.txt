G. blue_pantry

Owen exited the closet after staying there for 1 minute without making any movements (lines 5-6). At that time, the persimmon was in the blue_pantry (line 2). Owen did not witness any changes to the persimmon's location, and he did not have any private or public interactions with other agents that would change his belief about the persimmon's location. Therefore, Owen really thinks the persimmon is in the blue_pantry.
