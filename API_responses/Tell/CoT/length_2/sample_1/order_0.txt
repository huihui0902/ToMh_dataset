F. green_drawer

Explanation:
Initially, the persimmon is in the blue_pantry (line 2). Aiden moves it to the green_treasure_chest (line 7), and then Amelia moves it to the blue_pantry again (line 11). Finally, Amelia moves the persimmon to the green_drawer (line 18). There are no more movements of the persimmon mentioned in the story, so it remains in the green_drawer.
