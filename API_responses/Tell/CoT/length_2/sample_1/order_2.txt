G. blue_pantry

Explanation:
When Owen exited the closet, the persimmon was in the blue_pantry (Step 6). Amelia moved the persimmon to the green_drawer after Owen exited the closet (Step 18). However, Amelia and Owen have not been in the same location or had any interactions since then. Therefore, Amelia would think that Owen still believes the persimmon is in the blue_pantry.
