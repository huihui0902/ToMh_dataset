A. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
1. Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_cupboard (line 29).
2. Nathan privately told Noah that the potato is in the blue_crate (line 31).
3. Since Nathan and Ava were in the same location (waiting_room, line 27), Nathan can infer Ava's mental state.
4. Nathan knows that Ava heard Charlotte's public claim about the potato being in the blue_cupboard.
5. Noah would trust Nathan's private information about the potato being in the blue_crate since Nathan exited the garden later than Noah (line 16 and 26).
6. However, Ava doesn't know about Nathan's private communication with Noah, so she would still believe Charlotte's public claim about the potato being in the blue_cupboard.
7. Therefore, Nathan thinks Ava thinks Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is in the blue_cupboard.
