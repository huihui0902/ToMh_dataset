A. blue_cupboard

Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is in the blue_cupboard because Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_cupboard in line 29. Although agents tend to lie, Noah has no other information to contradict Charlotte's claim, so he would believe that Charlotte thinks the potato is in the blue_cupboard.
