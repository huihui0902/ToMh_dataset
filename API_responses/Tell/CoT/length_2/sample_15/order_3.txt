A. blue_cupboard

Explanation:
1. Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_cupboard (line 29). Since this is a public claim, Ava is aware of it.
2. Nathan privately told Noah that the potato is in the blue_crate (line 31). Since this is a private communication, Ava is not aware of it.
3. Ava exited the garden after Charlotte (lines 23 and 21), so she tends to trust Charlotte's claim.
4. Ava thinks that Noah, who was not present during the private communication between Nathan and Noah, would also trust Charlotte's claim since he exited the garden before Charlotte (line 16).

Therefore, Ava thinks Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is in the blue_cupboard.
