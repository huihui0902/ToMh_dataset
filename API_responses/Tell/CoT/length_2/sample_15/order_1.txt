A. blue_cupboard

Charlotte really thinks the potato is in the blue_cupboard. In line 29, Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_cupboard. Although agents tend to lie, there is no information suggesting that Charlotte has any reason to lie about the potato's location or that she has learned about any changes to the potato's location since she last saw it in the blue_cupboard (line 19).
