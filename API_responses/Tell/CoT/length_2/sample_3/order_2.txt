B. red_pantry

Explanation:
Hannah last saw the peas in the blue_treasure_chest (line 9) before exiting the hallway. However, she is not aware of the subsequent movements of the peas by Chloe, Isabella, Logan, and Emma. When Logan publicly claimed that the peas are in the green_bottle (line 25), Hannah has no reason to believe him since agents tend to lie. Emma privately told Logan that the peas are in the red_bottle (line 26), but Hannah is not aware of this private communication. Since Hannah knows that Emma exited the hallway after her, she would trust Emma's knowledge of the peas' location. The last action Emma took was moving the peas to the red_pantry (line 22), so Hannah would think that Emma thinks the peas are in the red_pantry.
