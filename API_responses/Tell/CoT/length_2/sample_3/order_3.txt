A. red_bottle

Explanation: 
1. When Chloe exited the hallway, the peas were in the red_bottle (step 12).
2. Hannah was the last person Chloe saw moving the peas (step 9), so Chloe thinks Hannah believes the peas are in the blue_treasure_chest.
3. Emma was the last person Hannah saw moving the peas (step 22), so Hannah thinks Emma believes the peas are in the red_pantry.
4. However, Emma privately told Logan that the peas are in the red_bottle (step 26), and since private communications are trusted, Hannah would trust Emma's private statement over her own observation.
5. Therefore, Chloe thinks Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas are in the red_bottle.
