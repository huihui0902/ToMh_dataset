B. red_pantry

Emma really thinks the peas are in the red_pantry because she was the last one to move the peas before exiting the hallway (step 22). She moved the peas from the blue_bathtub to the red_pantry. Although she privately told Logan that the peas are in the red_bottle (step 26), we should assume that agents tend to lie, so her actual belief is based on her own action of moving the peas to the red_pantry.
