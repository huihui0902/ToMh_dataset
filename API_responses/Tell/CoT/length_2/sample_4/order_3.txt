G. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
Step 1: Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase (line 11) and then exited the sunroom (line 13).
Step 2: Since William and Isla were in the same location (waiting_room) and had a private interaction (line 25), William thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_bathtub, as Isla told him. However, this information is not related to the cherry's location.
Step 3: Ava privately told Isla that the sweet_potato is in the green_drawer (line 24), but this information is also not related to the cherry's location.
Step 4: Since there is no other information exchange about the cherry's location, and Nathan was the last person to move the cherry, William and other agents would think that Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase, where he left it. Therefore, Ava thinks William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
