G. blue_suitcase

Explanation: Nathan was the last person to move the cherry in the sunroom, and he moved it to the blue_suitcase (step 11). Since there were no further movements or interactions regarding the cherry after Nathan exited the sunroom, his belief about the cherry's location remains unchanged. Therefore, Nathan really thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
