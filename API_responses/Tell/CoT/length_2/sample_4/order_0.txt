G. blue_suitcase

Explanation: The cherry's location can be traced through the story. It starts in the blue_suitcase (line 2), then Isla moves it to the red_bottle (line 7), Ava moves it to the green_basket (line 9), and finally, Nathan moves it back to the blue_suitcase (line 11). The story does not mention any further movements of the cherry, so it remains in the blue_suitcase.
