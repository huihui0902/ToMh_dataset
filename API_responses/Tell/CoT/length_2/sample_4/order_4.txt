G. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
1. Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase and exited the sunroom (step 11 and 13). So, Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
2. William didn't witness any changes to the cherry's location after he exited the sunroom (step 6). So, William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Isla privately told William that the sweet_potato is in the green_bathtub (step 25). This doesn't affect William's belief about the cherry. So, Ava thinks William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
4. Emma exited the laundry before Ava (step 18 and 20). According to the rule that an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself, Emma trusts Ava's belief. So, Emma thinks Ava thinks William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
