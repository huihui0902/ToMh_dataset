G. blue_suitcase

Explanation:
William was in the sunroom when Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase (step 11). Since there were no interactions between William and Nathan after that, William has no reason to believe that Nathan's knowledge has changed. Therefore, William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.
