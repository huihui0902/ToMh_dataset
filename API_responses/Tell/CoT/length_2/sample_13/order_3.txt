A. red_container

Explanation: Logan publicly claimed that the eggplant is in the red_box (line 27), which is unrelated to the watermelon's location. Jacob privately told Isla that the eggplant is in the red_pantry (line 28), also unrelated to the watermelon. Since Logan and Isla have not had any interaction regarding the watermelon, Logan would not have any reason to think Isla has any different information about the watermelon's location. The last known location of the watermelon for Logan is in the red_container (line 13), as he witnessed Isla moving it there before they all exited the front_yard. Therefore, Logan thinks Isla thinks Jacob thinks the watermelon is in the red_container.
