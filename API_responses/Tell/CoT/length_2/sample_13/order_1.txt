A. red_container

Explanation: In step 9, Jacob moved the watermelon to the red_basket. However, in step 13, Isla moved the watermelon back to the red_container. Since Jacob exited the front_yard before Isla (step 10), he would not have witnessed Isla's action. However, according to the assumption (3), Jacob would trust Isla, who exited the room later than him. Therefore, Jacob would believe that the watermelon is in the red_container.
