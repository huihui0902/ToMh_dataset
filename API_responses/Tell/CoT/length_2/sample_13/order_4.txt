A. red_container

Explanation: 
Sophia exited the front_yard before Isla moved the watermelon to the red_container (step 12 and 13). Therefore, Sophia thinks the watermelon is still in the red_basket, where Jacob left it (step 9). However, Logan, who was in the waiting_room with Sophia, publicly claimed that the eggplant is in the red_box (step 27). Since Sophia knows that agents tend to lie, she would assume that Logan is lying about the eggplant's location. This means that Sophia would think that Logan believes the watermelon is in the red_container, as it was before Jacob moved it. Since Isla was the last person to exit the front_yard and move the watermelon to the red_container (step 14), Sophia would think that Logan thinks Isla thinks Jacob thinks the watermelon is in the red_container.
