F. blue_container

Explanation: The watermelon's location can be traced through the story. It starts in the blue_bottle (line 3), then Benjamin moves it to the green_drawer (line 4), Isabella moves it to the blue_bucket (line 6), and finally, Charlotte moves it to the blue_container (line 11). No other movements of the watermelon are mentioned after that, so it remains in the blue_container.
