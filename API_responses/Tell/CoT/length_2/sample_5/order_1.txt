I. blue_bucket

Benjamin thinks the watermelon is in the blue_bucket because Isabella was the last person to move the watermelon before Benjamin exited the workshop (step 6). Although Charlotte moved the watermelon to the blue_container later (step 11), Benjamin had already exited the workshop and had no interaction with Charlotte to know about this change.
