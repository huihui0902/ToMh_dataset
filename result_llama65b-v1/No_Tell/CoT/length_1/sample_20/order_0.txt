### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where is the watermelon really?"
The key words are "really" and "watermelon". This means we need to find out where the watermelon actually is, as opposed to any false statements that may have been made.

2. Trace relevant movements step by step:
Mila moved the watermelon from the blue cupboard to the red box.
Ava then moved it from the red box to the green bottle.
Emily then moved it from the green bottle to the blue bathtub.
So at this point, the most recent movement was done by Emily, who put the watermelon in the blue bathtub.

3. Determine the last position of the watermelon:
Based on our tracing of the movements, the last position of the watermelon was the blue bathtub.

4. Output answer:
Therefore, the correct answer to the question "Where is the watermelon really?" is option H - blue bathtub.
