### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where is the lime really?"
The question asks us to find out where the lime actually is, as opposed to where it has been claimed to be. We need to look at the movements mentioned in the story and figure out which one was the most recent.

2. Trace the relevant movements step by step:
Emily moves the lime from the green envelope to the blue pantry.
Jack then takes the lime from the blue pantry and puts it into the blue suitcase.
However, we know that Emily lied about her own actions because she said she liked the green crate when she had actually put the lime there. This means that we can't trust what Jack says either since he came after Emily. So, we can assume that the lime is still in the green envelope.

3. Determine the last position of the lime:
Based on our analysis above, we can conclude that the lime is still in the green envelope.

4. Outputting the answer:
So, the correct answer to the question is option K - green envelope.
