### Assistant: 1. Evelyn knows where she put it herself. She put it into the green bucket. So we know her own opinion about this.
2. Evelyn has seen what Nathan did after he left the pantry. He saw a mouse but didn't move anything else. This means that Nathan still believes the plum is in the red drawer as he had not yet learned of its movement.
3. Evelyn also witnessed William making no moves inside the pantry. However, she was unaware of any other actions taken outside of the pantry so could not learn from them. Therefore, she would assume that William believed the plum was still in the red drawer like Nathan.
4. As such, Evelyn would believe that both Nathan and William thought the plum was in the red drawer when they left the pantry.
