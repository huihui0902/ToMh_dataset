### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where does Ella think Abigail thinks the banana is?"
This question has two levels of nested beliefs: Ella's belief about what Abigail believes, and Abigail's own belief. We need to determine where Abigail thinks the banana is, then figure out whether Ella shares this belief or not.

2. Trace the relevant information:
Elizabeth, Ava, Abigail, Ella and Owen enter the bedroom. At this point, none of them know anything about the location of the banana.
The next relevant event is when Abigail moves the banana into the blue bottle. This means that at least one person (Owen) knows that Abigail now believes the banana is in the blue bottle. However, we don't yet know whether any other characters are aware of this move.
Next, Abigail leaves the bedroom. Since she was the last person to leave, everyone else will assume that her beliefs haven't changed since entering the room - including her belief about the banana being in the blue bottle. So far, it seems like only Owen knows differently.
Later, Owen enters the room again and makes a claim that he moved the banana back into the envelope. It's unclear how many people believe this statement, but we do know that Abigail isn't present to hear it. She still believes the banana is in the blue bottle.
Finally, Ella enters the room. She sees that Owen has claimed to move the banana, but there's no way for her to verify this without checking herself. She also hasn't seen Abigail since she left the room, so she may not even realize that Abigail's beliefs have changed.
So, as far as we can tell, Ella would currently believe that Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue bottle. But we can't rule out the possibility that she might doubt Owen's claim, or have some other reason to suspect that Abigail's beliefs have changed.

3. Apply assumptions:
Based on our traced events, here are the key assumptions we need to consider:
* Agents can only learn new information from their own experiences or private/public conversations with other agents who were present in the same place.
* Agents tend to lie, but lying doesn't change their actual beliefs. They can only deceive others.
* Agents trust each other more if they've interacted recently, especially if they're the last ones to leave a shared space.
* Private conversations can't be overheard, while public statements can reach anyone in the same place.
From these assumptions, we can conclude that:
* Only Owen knows that Abigail lied about moving the banana. He could try to convince others, but unless they were in the room to witness the move themselves, they probably won't fully believe him.
* Ella didn't witness Owen's move either, so she likely has less confidence in his claim. She may default to assuming that Abigail's beliefs haven't changed since leaving the room.
* Even though Abigail lied, she still genuinely believed the banana was in the blue bottle when she said it. Her lie wouldn't have affected her own beliefs.

4. Final Answer: Based on our analysis, it seems most likely that Ella would still believe that Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue bottle. While she may have doubts about Owen's claim, she has no direct evidence to contradict it. And since Abigail wasn't present to hear Owen's statement, Ella has no reason to think that Abigail's beliefs have changed. Therefore, the best answer to the question is option B: Blue bathtub.
