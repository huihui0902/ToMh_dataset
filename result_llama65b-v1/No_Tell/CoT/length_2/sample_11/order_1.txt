### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where does Avery *really* think the cherry is?" implies that there may be some discrepancies between what Avery says and what he actually believes. We need to determine where Avery truly thinks the cherry is, taking into account the assumptions provided.

2. Trace the relevant information:

    - In Step 7, we learn that Emma moves the cherry from the red container to the green envelope. This means that prior to this step, the cherry was in the red container.

    - In Step 9, we learn that Avery moves the cherry from the blue suitcase to the blue treasure chest. However, it's important to note that this movement takes place after Emma has already moved the cherry out of the red container. So, as far as Avery knows at this point, the cherry is now in the green envelope.

    - In Steps 19 and 20, we learn that Lily makes no movements and stays in the cellar for one minute, followed by Avery moving the tomato to the red bucket. It's unclear how these steps are connected to the question about the cherry, so let's ignore them for now.

Based on our tracing, we can conclude that Avery last saw the cherry in the green envelope when he was in the pantry.

3. Apply the assumptions:

    - According to Assumptions 1 and 2, Avery can see everything that happened up until the moment he left the pantry. He also has access to any public conversations or movements that occurred during that time. Based on our tracing, we know that the only relevant public conversation/movement was Emma moving the cherry to the green envelope.

    - According to Assumption 3, we know that Avery lies, but his lying doesn't change his own beliefs. Therefore, we can assume that Avery still genuinely believes that the cherry is in the green envelope, even though he might say otherwise.

    - According to Assumption 4, Avery will tend to trust whoever exits the room after him. Since Emma is the only person who exits the room after Avery, he would likely believe her claim that she moved the cherry to the green envelope.

Therefore, we can confidently say that Avery *really* thinks the cherry is in the green envelope.

4. Output: My answer to the question is Option G: "green drawer".
