### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where is the cherry?"

The question asks where the cherry was located at the end of the story.

2. Trace relevant movements step by step:

Emily moved the cherry from the red drawer to the red container. This means that after this movement, the cherry was in the red container.
Later, Emma moved the cherry from the red container to the green envelope. So now we know that the cherry was in the green envelope.
However, Avery then moved the cherry again, this time from the green envelope to the blue suitcase. Therefore, the final location of the cherry was the blue suitcase.

3. Use your trace to determine the last position of the cherry:

Based on our tracing of the movements, we determined that the last position of the cherry was the blue suitcase.

4. Output your answer:

So the correct answer to the question "Where is the cherry?" is option H - "blue suitcase".
