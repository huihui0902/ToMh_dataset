### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is. This means we need to determine what Owen knows about the location of the lime, then figure out what Emily knows based on her knowledge of Owen's thoughts.

2. Trace the relevant information:
Owen has not interacted directly with the lime at any point in the story. However, he was present when Evelyn moved it from the red bottle to the green pantry. Based on this, we can assume that Owen believes the lime is currently in the green pantry.
Emily also witnessed Evelyn moving the lime to the green pantry. She also saw Lily move the lime back into the red bottle after leaving the attic. Since she did not enter the attic herself, she would not know that Lily had taken the lime out again. Therefore, Emily still believes the lime is in the green pantry.
Based on these observations, we can conclude that both Owen and Emily believe the lime is in the green pantry.

3. Apply assumptions:
We are told that agents tend to trust those who exit the room later than them. In this case, Owen left the front yard before Emily, so she may give more weight to his opinion. We are also told that agents do not necessarily share their true beliefs through public statements. While Owen has not explicitly stated his belief about the lime, we can infer it based on his actions and conversations.

4. Answer:
Based on our analysis, we can say that Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the green pantry. So the correct answer is choice B - "green pantry".
