### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where is the lemon?"

The question asks where the lemon was located at the end of the story.

2. Trace relevant movements step by step:

Evelyn moved the lemon from the red box to the red container.
Isla did not move anything and left the hall after one minute.
Alexander then took the lemon out of the red container and put it into the green treasure chest.
Emma also didn't touch the lemon but instead placed it inside a green bottle.
Sophia waited around for a bit as well without doing anything.
Then everyone went back to the waiting room.
Later, Alexander, Emma, and Evelyn go to the TV room. There are two lemons here now! One is in a red basket and the other is just sitting there.
Alexander does nothing so we know he isn't moving either of these lemons.
Emma takes the lemon from the red basket and puts it in a blue treasure chest. She must hate eggplants because she says so herself.
Finally, Evelyn waits around for a bit too like some of the others.
Everyone goes back to the waiting room again.
So, the final state of the lemons is this:
One is still in the red container.
Another is in the green bottle.
And finally, the third is in the blue treasure chest.

3. Determine the last position of the lemon:

Based on our traced steps, we can conclude that the lemon mentioned in the question is most likely referring to the one that ended up in the blue treasure chest since it was the last movement involving a lemon.

4. Output answer:

Therefore, the correct answer would be option M - "blue treasure chest".
