### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is. This means we need to determine what Lily knows about Noah's beliefs.

2. Trace the relevant information:
Lily enters the waiting room after Noah has already left it. So she would not know anything new from being there. She then goes into the front yard but again Noah had already left so nothing changes. Then she moves back to the waiting room. At this point she could hear any conversations between other people who were still present when she was gone. But as far as we are told none of them said anything relevant. When she leaves the waiting room next time she sees Isla leave first. From her behavior we can tell that she trusts Isla more because she left last. We also know that Isla saw Noah move the corn to the blue container. However, we don't know whether Isla actually believed Noah or not. It seems likely though since he did say he didn't like green peppers which rules out some options.
So at this point Lily believes that Noah put the corn in the blue container.

3. Apply assumptions:
We know that Lily will believe whatever Noah says unless she has reason not too. Since Noah never lied directly to her she will believe him. And since she trusts Isla more than herself she will believe Isla even without direct confirmation.

4. Answer:
Based on our analysis above, we can conclude that Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is in the blue container. Therefore, the correct answer is option F - "red_box".
