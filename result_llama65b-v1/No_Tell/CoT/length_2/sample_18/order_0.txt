### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where is the corn?" means we need to find out where the corn was located at the end of the story.

2. Trace relevant movements step by step:

The corn was initially in the blue treasure chest (S2).
Mila moved it to the blue container (S10).
Isla moved it back to the blue treasure chest (S16).
Lily moved it again to the green drawer (S23).

So, the final location of the corn is the green drawer (Option H).

3. Output: Based on my analysis, the correct answer to the question is Option H - Green Drawer.
