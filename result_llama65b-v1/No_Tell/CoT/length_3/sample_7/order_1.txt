### Assistant: 1. Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the green cupboard.
2. After seeing Chloe move it to the red bottle, she infers that he must know something about its location.
3. She also knows that Chloe has lied in the past, so she isn't sure if she can fully trust what he says.
4. However, since Chloe was the last one to leave the staircase, Evelyn tends to believe him more than her own inference.
5. Therefore, she concludes that the watermelon is likely still in the green cupboard.
