### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify what information is being asked about. In this case, it is "Where is the lettuce?" We also need to note any assumptions that are provided. These will help us make deductions as we work through the problem.

2. Next, we need to trace the relevant movements step by step. This means looking at each movement statement from the story and determining how it impacts our knowledge of where the lettuce is located. For example, the first movement statement says that Nathan moves the lettuce to the green cupboard. So after this move, we know that the lettuce is now in the green cupboard.

3. After tracing all of the relevant movements, we need to determine the last position of the lettuce. Based on our analysis of the movements, we can conclude that the final location of the lettuce was in the green cupboard.

4. Finally, we can output our answer. In this case, the correct response would be "K" because the lettuce was left in the blue container.
