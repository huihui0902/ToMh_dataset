### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify what information is being asked about. In this case, it is "Where is the green_pepper?" This means that our focus will be on tracking the movement of the green_pepper throughout the story.

2. Next, we need to trace the relevant movements involving the green_pepper step by step. Here are those steps:

* Step 1: Jackson moves the green_pepper from the red_basket to the blue_container.
* Step 2: Jackson leaves the living_room, taking the green_pepper with him.
* Step 3: Emma stays in the living_room for one minute without moving anything.
* Step 4: Emma leaves the living_room, but she did not move the green_pepper so it remains where Jackson left it - in the blue_container.
* Step 5: Abigail also stays in the living_room for one minute without moving anything.
* Step 6: Abigail leaves the living_room, again leaving the green_pepper where it was.
* Step 7: Logan makes no movements and stays in the living_room for one minute.
* Step 8: Logan leaves the living_room, still leaving the green_pepper where it was.
* Step 9: At this point, the green_pepper has remained in the blue_container since Jackson put it there in Step 1. No other movements have occurred after that point which would change its location.

3. Based on our traced movements, we can conclude that the last known location of the green_pepper is the blue_container. Therefore, the correct answer to the question "Where is the green_pepper really?" is option C, "green_cupboard".
