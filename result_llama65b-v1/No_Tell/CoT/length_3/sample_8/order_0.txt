### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify what information is being asked about. In this case, it is "where is the lemon". We also need to note any assumptions that are provided, as these will help us make deductions.

2. Next, we need to trace the relevant movements related to the lemon. This involves looking at each statement involving the lemon and noting where it was moved to. Here is a list of the relevant statements:

* Statement 3: Jack moved the lemon to the blue_pantry.
* Statement 5: Liam moved the lemon to the blue_crate.
* Statement 7: Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket.
* Statement 11: Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer.

We can see from these statements that the lemon has been moved several times. However, we need to consider which movement came last, since this is what matters for determining its current location.

3. Now we need to determine the last position of the lemon. From our tracing, we know that the most recent movement of the lemon was when Nathan moved it to the green_drawer in Statement 11. Therefore, we can conclude that the lemon is currently located in the green_drawer.

4. Finally, we need to provide an answer to the question. Based on our analysis, we can confidently say that the lemon is located in the green_drawer.
