### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where Aiden thinks the lemon is after all the events listed in the story.

2. Trace the relevant information:
After event 3, Jack has moved the lemon from the green drawer to the blue pantry. After event 5, Liam moves it back to the green crate. Then after event 7, Aiden moves it again to the green basket. So far we know that Aiden knows about these two movements because he was in the same places as them at those times. However, after this point there are no more mentions of lemons until after event 24 when everyone enters the waiting room together. At this time, Aiden would not yet know about any further changes to the location of the lemon.

3. Apply assumptions:
Based on our assumptions, we can say that Aiden will believe what other agents tell him unless he has reason to doubt their honesty. In this case, both Jack and Liam were truthful about their actions so Aiden will believe that the lemon is currently in the green basket. He also won't know anything about the subsequent events involving Nathan and the eggplant since he wasn't present for those.

4. Final Answer:
So my final answer is that Aiden thinks the lemon is in the green basket.
