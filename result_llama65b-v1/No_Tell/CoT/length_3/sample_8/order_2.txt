### Assistant: 1. Break down the question into its components:
* Who is asking the question? - Nathan
* Who is being asked about? - Aiden
* What are we inquiring about? - The location of the lemon

2. Trace back through the story steps involving Nathan and Aiden:
* Step 3: Nathan enters the garage after Jack moves the lemon to the blue pantry. He sees the lemon there.
* Step 5: Aiden enters the garage after Nathan has already seen the lemon in the blue pantry. He then moves it to the blue crate.
* Step 6: Nathan exits the garage without seeing this movement.

3. Apply the assumptions to our traced events:
* Agents can see things before leaving a space (assumption 1). This means Nathan knows where the lemon was when he left the garage.
* Public conversations can be heard by everyone present (assumption 3). Since neither Nathan nor Aiden said anything about the lemon, Nathan would not know about Aiden moving it.
* Agents tend to trust those who leave a space last (assumption 4). In this case, Nathan would believe what he saw himself rather than any subsequent changes.

4. Output the final answer: Based on these deductions, Nathan would still believe the lemon to be in the blue pantry as he never saw otherwise. Therefore, option B is correct.
