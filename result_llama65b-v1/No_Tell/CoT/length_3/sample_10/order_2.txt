### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet potato is. This means we need to determine what Logan knows about Evelyn's knowledge.

2. Trace the relevant information:
Logan has seen Evelyn move the sweet potato into the blue cupboard (step 6). He also witnessed her leaving the kitchen without moving it again (step 7), so he knows she still believes it to be there. However, this was after steps 8 and 9 had occurred, meaning Evelyn did not know that William had moved the sweet potato back to the red container. Therefore, Logan may believe that Evelyn still thinks it is in the blue cupboard.

3. Apply assumptions:
According to assumption 2, Logan can infer Evelyn's thoughts based on their shared time in the kitchen. Since they were both present when Evelyn moved the sweet potato, he can assume she believed it to be in the blue cupboard at that point.

4. Output:
Based on these deductions, the most likely answer is **C** - "green_bathtub".
