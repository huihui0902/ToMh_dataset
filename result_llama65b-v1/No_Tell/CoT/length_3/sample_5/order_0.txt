### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify what information is being asked about. In this case, it is "where is the peas?" This indicates that our focus will be on tracking the location of the peas throughout the story.

2. Next, we need to trace the relevant movements involving the peas step by step. Here are those steps:

Step 1: Peas were originally located in the green_basket (statement #2).

Step 2: Mila did not move anything when she was in the patio (statements #5 and #6), so the peas remained in the green_basket.

Step 3: Amelia also did not move anything when she was in the patio (statement #7), so again the peas remained in the green_basket.

Step 4: Jackson liked the green_bathtub (statement #9), but he didn't mention anything about moving the peas. So we can assume that the peas still remain in the green_basket after Jackson left the patio (statement #8).

Step 5: Hannah moved the peas from the green_basket to the blue_bathtub (statement #10).

Step 6: After Hannah left the patio (statement #11), the peas were now located in the blue_bathtub.

Step 7: Mila, Amelia, Jackson, Hannah, and Abigail then went into the waiting_room (statement #14). We don't know what happened to the peas at this point since there are no more statements related to them.

Step 8: Hannah, Amelia, and Mila went into the lounge (statement #15). There were several moves involving other items like the lemon and the sweet potato, but none of these involved the peas.

Step 9: Hannah, Abigail, Mila, and Jackson went into the closet (statement #36). Again, there were some moves involving other items, but nothing related to the peas.

Based on these steps, we can conclude that the most recent statement involving the peas was Step 7 where they were in the blue_bathtub. Therefore, the last known location of the peas was in the blue_bathtub.
