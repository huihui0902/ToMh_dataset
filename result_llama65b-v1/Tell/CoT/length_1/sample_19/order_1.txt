### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where does Logan really think the green pepper is?" This means we need to determine what Logan believes about the location of the green pepper after taking into account all available information up until he left the den.

2. Trace the relevant information:
* Step 9: Logan moves the green pepper from the drawer to the crate. He may not know where it originally was, but this action suggests that he thinks it is now in the crate.
* Steps 1-8: No other relevant actions take place before Logan enters the den.
* Steps 13-14: After leaving the den, Ella makes a public claim that the green pepper is in the pantry, which contradicts Logan's knowledge. However, since she has not been in the den, her claim holds no weight for Logan.
* Steps 11-12: Before leaving the den, Elizabeth privately informs Ella that the green pepper is actually in the drawer. Since Logan has not interacted with either of them directly, he would not be aware of this information.

3. Applying assumptions:
* Assumptions 1 & 2 suggest that Logan can see all previous actions and knows that the green pepper was in the drawer before being moved to the crate.
* Assumption 3 indicates that Logan will likely believe his own perceptions over those of others who have not been in the den.
* Assumption 4 implies that Logan will trust Elizabeth's statement more than Ella's because she exited the den after him.

Based on these deductions, we can conclude that Logan still believes the green pepper is in the drawer despite having moved it himself. His action of moving it to the crate could simply reflect confusion or uncertainty rather than certainty that it belonged there. Therefore, the correct answer is **(B).**
