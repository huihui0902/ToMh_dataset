### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where does Amelia really think the tangerine is?"

The key words here are "really" and "think". This means we need to consider what Amelia actually believes, rather than just her public statements or actions.

2. Trace the relevant information:

Amelia has not moved the tangerine herself, so she must be basing her belief off of other people's actions. She has seen Ava enter and leave the cellar without moving anything, then Sophia move the tangerine into the green bottle. Next, she saw Carter move it back into the red basket. Finally, she heard Abigail claim that the tangerine was still in the green bottle.

So far, this would lead us to believe that Amelia thinks the tangerine is in the green bottle. However, we also know from the assumption that agents tend to lie, which casts doubt on Abigail's statement. We also know that Amelia will trust someone who left the cellar after her more than those who left before her. In this case, both Sophia and Carter left after her, but only Carter said something contradictory to Abigail's claim.

Based on these clues, we can say that Amelia probably suspects that the tangerine may not be where Abigail says it is, since she heard conflicting reports. But she hasn't yet decided whether to trust Sophia or Carter's version of events.

3. Applying assumptions:

We can use our first two assumptions to help us here. Since Amelia has been in the cellar, she knows that Sophia did indeed move the tangerine into the green bottle. So we can assume that part of her belief is accurate. On the other hand, we don't know how much weight she gives to Carter's private message vs. Abigail's public one. It could depend on their relationship or personal biases.

However, we do know that Amelia will give more credence to someone who left the cellar after her. And Carter was the last person to leave before her, making his statement the most recent. Based on this, we might expect Amelia to put slightly more stock in Carter's version of events, even though he lied about liking the corn.

4. Final Answer:

Putting all this together, we can conclude that Amelia currently believes the tangerine is likely in the red basket, as per Carter's statement. However, she remains somewhat uncertain due to the conflicting information she received. Her final belief could shift depending on further evidence or conversations.
