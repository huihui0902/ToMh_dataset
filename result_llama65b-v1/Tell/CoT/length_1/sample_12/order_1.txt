### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where does Ava *really* think the tangerine is?" implies that there may be some discrepancies between what Ava has said publicly/privately and her true beliefs. We need to determine where she actually believes the tangerine is located.

2. Trace the relevant information:

    - Step 12: Ava enters the waiting room after everyone else has already left. She knows that Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, and Alexander have each made one move involving the tangerine. However, since she hasn't interacted with any of them directly, she can't infer their thoughts.

    - Steps 14 & 15: Elizabeth makes a public claim that the tangerine is in the blue crate, but then privately tells Ava that it's actually in the red basket. This suggests that Elizabeth is lying about the location of the tangerine, possibly because she wants to mislead other agents who might enter the waiting room later.

    - Step 13: Ava exits the waiting room without making any moves or statements. At this point, we don't know what she truly believes.

Based on these steps, we can conclude that Ava has access to conflicting information from different sources:

    1. Public Claim: Elizabeth says the tangerine is in the blue crate.
    2. Private Information: Elizabeth tells Ava that the tangerine is actually in the red basket.

We need to determine which piece of information Ava will believe more strongly.

3. Applying assumptions:

    - Assumptions 1 & 2 suggest that Ava can see all previous moves and interactions up until the moment she leaves the waiting room. Since she entered last, she would have seen all of the previous moves and claims.

    - Assumption 3 states that agents tend to lie, so we shouldn't automatically assume that Elizabeth's claims are accurate.

    - Assumption 4 indicates that agents tend to trust those who exit the room later than themselves. In this case, Ava would likely give more weight to Elizabeth's private statement than her public claim.

Therefore, we can assume that Ava will believe Elizabeth's private statement that the tangerine is in the red basket.

4. Final Answer: Based on our analysis, we can confidently say that Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red basket. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice E ("blue_crate").
