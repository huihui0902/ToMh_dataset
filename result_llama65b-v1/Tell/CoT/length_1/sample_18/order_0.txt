### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question: "Where is the cabbage really?"
The key words are "really" and "cabbage". This means we need to find out where the cabbage actually is, as opposed to any false statements that may have been made about it.

2. Trace relevant movements step by step:
Step 1: Logan moves the cabbage from the red bucket to the green pantry.
Step 2: Nathan then moves the cabbage from the red box to the green cupboard.
Step 3: Isabella makes no movement but stays in the master bedroom for one minute. She then leaves without doing anything further.
Step 4: Aiden also makes no movement and remains in the master bedroom for one minute. He too leaves without taking any action.
Step 5: Finally, William enters the master bedroom after everyone else has left. He does not move the cabbage nor make any statement about its location.

3. Determine the last position of the cabbage:
Based on our tracing of the movements, we know that the most recent change was when Nathan moved the cabbage from the red box to the green cupboard. Therefore, this is the current location of the cabbage.

4. Output answer:
So my answer would be option D - Red Box
