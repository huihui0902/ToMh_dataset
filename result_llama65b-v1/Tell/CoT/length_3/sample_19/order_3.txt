### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify who knows what about where the cherry is located:

Logan - Logan has been in the cellar twice, once after Ava and once after Amelia. He saw Ava move the cherry into the green bucket and then Amelia move it back out again. So he knows that both of them believe the cherry was in the green bucket at some point. However, since he also witnessed Ava moving the cherry there himself, he may not consider this as strong evidence.

William - William has never been in the cellar, so he has no direct knowledge of any of these events. His claim that "the cherry is in the blue container" could either come from something he overheard someone else saying, or just be a random guess. We don't know enough to say whether he believes this statement himself.

Ava - Ava has been in the cellar three times, but each time she has simply stood still without making any moves. She would have seen Logan moving the cherry into the green bucket when she first arrived, but nothing more until her final visit. On this occasion, she saw Amelia moving the cherry out of the green basket and into the blue container. Since she had already seen Logan put it there herself, she might assume that this means that Amelia now believes it is in the blue container too.

So, to summarize, we have:
* Logan - Knows the cherry was in the green bucket because he put it there, but isn't sure if other people believe this.
* William - Hasn't been in the cellar, so has limited knowledge. May or may not believe the cherry is in the blue container.
* Ava - Believes the cherry is in the blue container because she saw Amelia move it there.

2. Now let's look at how their beliefs interact with each other:

* Logan - Logan has been in the same space as everyone except William, so he will trust their statements more than those of people he hasn't met. This means he will give weight to Ava's claim that the cherry is in the blue container, even though he knows she didn't actually move it there herself.

* Ava - As mentioned above, Ava believes the cherry is in the blue container because she saw Amelia move it there. She has also been in the same space as Logan, so she will trust his actions over anything she has heard secondhand.

* William - Since William hasn't been in the cellar, he won't have any reason to trust or distrust anyone else's claims directly. If he makes a statement, it must come from something he has overheard or assumed on his own.

From this, we can conclude that Logan will probably believe that Ava thinks the cherry is in the blue container, which lines up with her own belief. But we can't say for certain what William thinks, since we don't know where his information comes from.

3. Applying the assumptions, we can rule out several options immediately:

* Green envelope (G), red pantry (F), red crate (D), green box (H), blue cupboard (I), red bottle (J), green pantry (K) are all locations outside the cellar, so nobody has visited them recently. It's unlikely that anyone would make confident claims about objects being there.
* Blue container (L) is the correct answer! Logan saw Ava move the cherry there, and Ava saw Amelia do the same thing. They both trust each other's actions, so they will believe the cherry is really there.

That leaves us with two remaining possibilities:

* Red bucket (M): Logan saw Ava move the cherry into the green bucket, but he wasn't sure if she believed it was really there. And although Ava saw Amelia move it out again, she knew that Amelia hadn't put it there herself. So neither of them were fully convinced that the cherry was in the green bucket.
* Green basket (N): This is where things get tricky. Although Ava saw Amelia move the cherry into the green basket, she also knew that Amelia had taken it out of the blue container first. So she couldn't be completely sure if Amelia thought the cherry belonged there or not. Similarly, Logan saw Ava move the cherry into the green bucket, but he also saw Amelia take it out again. Neither of them could be totally confident that the other person believed the cherry was in the green basket.

Based on this, we can say that Logan and Ava both considered the possibility that the cherry was in the green basket, but weren't entirely convinced. In contrast, they were much surer that the cherry was in the blue container. Therefore, we can say that Logan thinks Ava thinks the cherry is most likely in the blue container, with the green basket as a less convincing alternative.

Therefore, the best answer to the question is option L: "blue container".
