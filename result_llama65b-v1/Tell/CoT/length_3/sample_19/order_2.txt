### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to identify who knows what about where the cherry is located. We know that Ava has seen everyone's actions up until she left the cellar, so she has the most complete picture of the situation. She also had a private conversation with William, which means she knows what he knows. So, we need to start from there.
