### Assistant: 1. To break down the question, we need to understand what each part of it means:

* "Where" refers to the location where something is believed to be. In this case, it's asking about the specific container or object that holds the peas.
* "Logan" is one of the agents mentioned in the story. We are being asked to determine what he believes about Jackson's thoughts on the location of the peas.
* "Jackson" is another agent mentioned in the story. We need to figure out what Logan thinks Jackson believes about the location of the peas.
* "thinks" indicates that we are dealing with beliefs rather than physical reality. We need to keep track of what each agent knows and believes throughout the story.
* "the peas" is the item that is being discussed. It has been moved around several times during the course of the story, so we need to pay attention to its current location as well as any previous locations mentioned.
* "is" simply indicates that we are looking for a statement of fact - in this case, what Logan believes Jackson believes about the location of the peas.

Now let's look at how to approach breaking down the question further:

2. To start tracing the relevant information from the story, we first need to identify which parts of the story involve these three agents. Here are some key events involving Logan, Jackson, and/or Jackson:

* Logan makes no movements and stays in the hallway for 1 minute (step #5). This suggests that Logan may not yet know anything about the peas at this point.
* Jackson moves the peas to the red crate (step #8). Since Jackson is moving the peas, it seems likely that he now believes it is located there. However, since Jackson hasn't left the hallway yet, it's possible that other agents don't yet know about this change.
* Jackson exits the hallway (step #6). At this point, Jackson has shared his knowledge of the peas' new location with everyone who was already in the hallway (including Logan), but not with anyone outside the hallway.
* Jackson dislikes the turnip (step #13). This piece of information isn't directly relevant to our question, but it could potentially influence Jackson's behavior or decision making in future steps.
* Jackson enters the waiting room (step #27). Now Jackson has rejoined the group of agents who were previously in the hallway, including Logan. He still believes the peas are in the red crate, but he also now knows that nobody else has moved them since then.
* Jackson privately tells Emily that the peas are in the red crate (step #40). This information will only be available to Emily and Jackson, not to Logan.
* Jackson privately tells Logan that the peas are in the red crate (step #41). Now both Logan and Jackson believe that the peas are in the red crate, although neither of them has actually seen them there themselves.

From here, we can continue tracing the relevant information through the rest of the story:

* Emily moves the peas to the green bathtub (step #24). She must either not know or not care that Jackson had previously put them in the red crate.
* Emily exits the attic (step #25). At this point, she has shared her knowledge of the peas' new location with everyone who was already in the attic (including Jackson), but not with anyone outside the attic.
* Jackson dislikes the cucumber (step #22). Again, this isn't directly relevant to our question, but it could potentially impact his decisions going forward.
* Jackson enters the waiting room again (step #28). Now he has rejoined the group of agents who were previously in the hallway, including Logan. He still believes the peas are in the green bathtub, but he also now knows that nobody else has moved them since then.
* Jackson privately tells Logan that the peas are in the green bathtub (step #44). Now both Logan and Jackson believe that the peas are in the green bathtub, although neither of them has actually seen them there themselves.

So far, we haven't found any evidence to suggest that Logan has ever believed the peas were anywhere except the green bathtub. Let's continue tracing the relevant information:

* Logan moves the peas to the blue cupboard (step #39). He must either not know or not care that Jackson had previously put them in the green bathtub.
* Logan exits the patio (step #40). At this point, he has shared his knowledge of the peas' new location with everyone who was already in the patio (including Jackson), but not with anyone outside the patio.
* Jackson privately tells Emily that the peas are in the blue cupboard (step #44). Now both Jackson and Emily believe that the peas are in the blue cupboard, although neither of them has actually seen them there themselves.
* Jackson enters the waiting room again (step #45). Now he has rejoined the group of agents who were previously in the hallway, including Logan. He still believes the peas are in the blue cupboard, but he also now knows that nobody else has moved them since then.
* Jackson privately tells Logan that the peas are in the blue cupboard (step #46). Now both Logan and Jackson believe that the peas are in the blue cupboard, although neither of them has actually seen them there themselves.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that Logan thinks Jackson thinks jack thinks the pea is in the blue cupboard.
