### Assistant: 1. Break down the question into simpler parts:

* Where does Jackson think...? -> Jackson has a belief about something
* ...the peas is? -> We are talking about the location of the peas

2. Trace the relevant information from the story:

* Step 1: Peas was placed in the blue suitcase (step #2). This is public knowledge as it happened before any of the agents entered the hallway.
* Step 2: Jackson did not move anything when he was in the hallway (steps #5 & #6), so this information remains unchanged.
* Step 3: Jack moves the peas to the red crate (step #8). This happens after Jackson left the hallway, so Jackson would not know about this change.
* Step 4: Emily then moves the peas back to the green bottle (step #10). Again, this happens after Jackson left the hallway, so he wouldn't know about this either.
* Step 5: Jackson privately tells Logan that the peas is in the green bottle (step #13). So we now know what Jackson believes - he thinks the peas is still in the green bottle.

3. Applying the assumptions:

* According to assumption #2, since Jackson and Jack were both in the hallway at some point, Jackson could potentially learn about Jack moving the peas to the red crate. However, according to our traced steps above, Jackson didn't find out about this movement because it happened after he had already left the hallway. Therefore, we can conclude that Jackson still believes the peas is in the green bottle.

4. Answer: Based on our analysis, we can say that Jackson thinks Jack also thinks the peas is in the green bottle. So the correct answer is choice "G" - green pantry.
