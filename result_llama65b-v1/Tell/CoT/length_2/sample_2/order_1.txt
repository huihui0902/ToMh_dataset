### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where Owen thinks the onion is after he has had some experiences in the story. We need to consider what Owen knows from these experiences and how it might influence his thoughts.

2. Trace the relevant information:
Owen first enters the porch and sees the onion in the red crate. He then moves the onion to the red drawer but does not say anything about this move. Later, when Isabella makes her claim that the onion is in the green cupboard, Owen privately tells Emily that the onion is actually in the blue crate. This suggests that Owen still believes the onion is in the blue crate even though Isabella has made a different claim.

3. Applying assumptions:
Based on the assumptions, we know that Owen can see everything that happens in the porch before he leaves. So he will know that Isabella has claimed that the onion is in the green cupboard. However, since he was there earlier and saw the onion being moved to the blue crate, he may not believe this claim. Since he has also had a private conversation with Emily, he may trust her more than Isabella who has made a public claim.

4. Answer:
Based on our analysis, we can conclude that Owen probably still thinks the onion is in the blue crate despite Isabella's claim. His private conversation with Emily supports this idea as well. Therefore, the correct answer would be "C" - green_drawer.
