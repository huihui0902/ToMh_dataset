### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where **William** thinks **Nathan** thinks the cherry is. This means we need to determine what **William** knows about the cherry's location at this point in time.

2. Trace the relevant information:
We start from the beginning of the story:

* Step 1: Emma, William, Isla, Ava and Nathan enter the sunroom. At this point, none of them know anything about the cherry's location.
* Step 2: The cherry is placed in the blue suitcase. Only whoever performed this action (Isla) knows about it.
* Steps 3-6: Emma and William stay in the sunroom without moving the cherry. They still don't know its location.
* Steps 7-10: Isla moves the cherry to the red bottle, then Ava moves it back to the green basket. Both of them now know the cherry's new location. However, neither of them has left the sunroom yet, so William and Emma are still unaware.
* Steps 11-12: Nathan moves the cherry again, but he also hasn't left the sunroom yet, so everyone else remains oblivious.
* Steps 13-14: Everyone leaves the sunroom. Now only Nathan knows where the cherry is.
* Steps 15-16: Emma, Ava and Isla go into the laundry together. None of them move the cherry there, so their knowledge stays the same as before.
* Steps 17-20: Emma, Ava and Isla take turns moving the sweet potato around. Again, none of them mention the cherry, so we can ignore these steps.
* Step 21: Everyone returns to the waiting room. Still nobody mentions the cherry.
* Step 22: Ava privately tells Isla that the sweet potato is in the green drawer. Since this is a private conversation, William doesn't hear it.
* Step 23: Isla privately tells William that the sweet potato is in the green bathtub. Again, since this is a private conversation, Nathan isn't involved.

So far, we haven't found any evidence that William knows where the cherry is. Let's keep going...

* Step 24: Ava enters the waiting room alone. She already knew about the sweet potato being in the green drawer, but she didn't tell anyone else about it. So nothing changes here.
* Step 25: Isla enters the waiting room alone. She already knew about both locations of the sweet potato, but she didn't say anything either.

At this point, we can conclude that William still doesn't know where the cherry is. He may suspect that someone moved it, but he doesn't have enough information to make an accurate guess.

3. Apply the assumptions:
Now let's look at how the assumptions might change our understanding of the situation:

* Assumption 1 says that agents can see everything that happens before they leave a room. In this case, William was present when Isla put the cherry in the blue suitcase, so he must have seen her do it. Therefore, he knows that the cherry used to be there.
* Assumptions 2 and 3 state that agents can learn things through private conversations or observations in the same space. But we already determined that William wasn't part of those conversations, and he hadn't returned to the sunroom after Isla moved the cherry. So he wouldn't have gained any new information from those sources.
* Assumption 4 suggests that William would trust Nathan more than himself, because Nathan left the sunroom last. However, Nathan never mentioned the cherry after leaving, so this assumption doesn't seem relevant.

Based on these considerations, we can conclude that William's opinion on the cherry's location hasn't changed since Step 2. He still believes it's in the blue suitcase, even though he knows someone must have moved it afterwards.

4. Final answer:
Therefore, the correct answer to the question "Where does William think Nathan thinks the cherry is?" is **Step 2** - the **blue suitcase**.
