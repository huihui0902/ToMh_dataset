### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where Ava thinks William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is. To answer this question, we need to work backwards from Nathan to Ava. We start with what Nathan thinks about the cherry:
Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue suitcase.
We then look at what William knows about the cherry. He has seen a cat, which gives us no new information about the cherry. However, he also knows that Ava has moved the cherry into the green basket. Based on this knowledge, we can assume that William thinks the cherry is in the green basket.
Finally, we come to Ava. She has not directly interacted with the cherry, but she has heard William say that it is in the green basket. So, we can assume that Ava also thinks the cherry is in the green basket. Therefore, our final answer is option "G" - Ava thinks William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue suitcase.

2. Trace the relevant information:
Emma, William, Isla, Ava and Nathan enter the sunroom.
Cherry is in the blue suitcase.
Emma stays still for one minute and leaves.
William stays still for one minute and sees a cat. Then he moves out.
Isla takes the cherry and puts it in the red bottle. Then she goes away.
Ava takes the cherry and places it in the green basket. Afterwards, she leaves.
Nathan takes the cherry and puts it back in the blue suitcase. Then he departs.
Everyone enters the waiting room again.
Emma, Ava and Isla go to the laundry together.
Sweet potato is found in the green drawer.
Emma takes the sweet potato and puts it in the green cupboard.
She comes out afterward.
Ava takes the sweet potato and puts it in the blue cupboard.
Then she leaves as well.
Isla takes the sweet potato and puts it in the green bathtub.
After leaving the laundry, everyone gathers in the waiting room once more.
Ava secretly informs Isla that the sweet potato is in the green drawer.
Isla privately tells William that the sweet potato is in the green bathtub.

Based on these events, we know that:
* Nathan believes the cherry is in the blue suitcase because he put it there himself.
* William believes the cherry is in the green basket because he heard Ava say so.
* Ava believes the cherry is in the green basket because she moved it there herself.
* Isla has no direct knowledge of the cherry's location.

It's important to note that none of them are aware of each other's private conversations, so their beliefs remain unchanged by those revelations.

3. Applying assumptions:
According to the first assumption, since nobody has left the waiting room yet, everybody shares the same knowledge up until this point. This means that:
* All five agents believe the cherry is in the blue suitcase.
* They also believe the sweet potato is in the green drawer.

Next, according to the second assumption, when Ava and Isla leave the laundry, they share any new knowledge they gained inside. In particular:
* Ava now knows that the sweet potato is in the green bathtub thanks to Isla's statement.
* Isla now knows that the sweet potato is in both the green drawer and bathtub due to her own action and Ava's claim.

However, neither of them has mentioned anything about the cherry, so their opinions on its location haven't changed.

Later, when Ava and William meet in the waiting room, they engage in a private conversation. According to the third assumption, this exchange will only impact their individual perceptions, not the group consensus. Specifically:
* Ava reveals that the sweet potato is in the green drawer, which William didn't previously know.
* William says nothing about the cherry, so Ava learns nothing new regarding it.

At this stage, we have enough information to determine how each person perceives the situation:
* Nathan continues to believe the cherry is in the blue suitcase.
* William now believes the cherry is in the green basket (from seeing Ava move it), and the sweet potato is in the green drawer (from talking to Ava).
* Ava now believes the cherry is in the green basket (as before), and the sweet potato is in both the green drawer and bathtub (based on her actions and Isla's statement).
* Isla still believes the cherry is in the blue suitcase, and the sweet potato is in the green drawer and bathtub.

Now we can focus specifically on Ava's thoughts about William's opinion. Since she hasn't spoken to him recently, we can assume that her understanding of his views remains unaltered. Thus, she would expect him to believe the cherry is in the green basket, just like she does.

Therefore, the correct answer is "G".
