### Assistant: 1. Breakdown of the question:
The question asks where Evelyn thinks Jack thinks the apple is. This means we need to determine what Evelyn believes about Jack's belief.

2. Trace the relevant information:
Evelyn has not interacted directly with Jack, so she does not know his thoughts. However, she has been in the same places as Jack at different times. She was in the den when Jack moved the apple to the green bottle, but she did not make any moves herself. Then, both Evelyn and Jack were in the waiting room together after their time in the den. At this point, Jack had already made his move with the apple. So, Evelyn may have seen Jack leave the den and enter the waiting room, which could lead her to believe that he still holds the same belief about the apple's location.

3. Applying assumptions:
Based on the assumptions, we can say that Evelyn will likely trust Jack's claim about the apple being in the green bottle since it came from someone who left the den more recently. Even though Jack lied about moving the apple, Evelyn would not know this unless she saw him do it herself. Since she didn't make any moves in the den, she wouldn't have witnessed Jack's action. Therefore, she might assume that the apple is indeed in the green bottle, based on Jack's statement.

4. Final Answer:
Based on my analysis, I would say that Evelyn probably thinks that Jack thinks the apple is in the green bottle. Her belief is influenced by Jack's recent actions and statements, even though those statements are lies.
