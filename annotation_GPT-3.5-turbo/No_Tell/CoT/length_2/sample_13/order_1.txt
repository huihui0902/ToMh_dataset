Question: Where does Carter really think the watermelon is?
Answer: green_basket
Choices: A. green_envelope, B. blue_suitcase, C. red_envelope, D. green_basket, E. blue_bucket, F. green_cupboard, G. blue_treasure_chest, H. green_crate, I. red_drawer, J. green_box, K. green_drawer, L. green_treasure_chest, M. green_bathtub, N. blue_pantry, O. red_bottle

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_basket
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the watermelon and Carter's movements. According to the story, the watermelon was initially in the blue_suitcase, then Sophia moved it to the green_envelope, and finally, Carter moved it to the green_basket. Carter exited the workshop after moving the watermelon to the green_basket. Since Carter exited the workshop after Avery, he tends to trust Avery's claim that he dislikes the tomato. Therefore, we can assume that Carter did not move the watermelon to the red_envelope, blue_bucket, green_cupboard, blue_treasure_chest, green_crate, red_drawer, green_drawer, green_treasure_chest, green_bathtub, red_bottle, or blue_pantry. The only option left is the green_basket, which is where Carter really thinks the watermelon is. Therefore, the answer is D. green_basket.
