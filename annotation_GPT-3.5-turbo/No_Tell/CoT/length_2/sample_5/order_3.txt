Question: Where does Emma think Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is?
Answer: green_box
Choices: A. red_envelope, B. green_envelope, C. green_box, D. blue_bucket, E. blue_pantry, F. green_basket, G. blue_drawer, H. red_container, I. green_bucket, J. green_bathtub, K. red_box, L. green_crate, M. blue_container, N. green_drawer, O. red_bottle

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_box
GPT-4 Explain: This question requires a lot of careful reading and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Emma think Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is?

2. We know that Aiden likes the blue_bucket, but we don't know anything about where he thinks the cabbage is.

3. Avery moved the cabbage to the green_envelope, so we know that's where it currently is.

4. Emma likes the red_envelope, but we don't know anything about where she thinks the cabbage is.

5. We know that Noah moved the cabbage to the green_box, but we don't know if any of the other characters know this.

6. Emma and Aiden were both in the staircase, but we don't know if they had any interactions or if Emma overheard anything Aiden said.

7. Avery and Jackson were also in the staircase, but we don't know if they had any interactions with Emma or Aiden.

8. Aiden, Avery, and Jackson all entered the staircase together after the cabbage was moved to the green_box, so they all know where it currently is.

9. Aiden, Avery, and Jackson all exited the staircase in that order, so they all trust each other's knowledge of where the cabbage is.

10. Emma exited the staircase after Aiden, so she would trust his knowledge of where the cabbage is.

Based on all of this information, we can deduce that Emma thinks Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is in the green_envelope, since that's where it currently is and Aiden would trust Avery's knowledge of its location. Therefore, the answer is B. green_envelope.
