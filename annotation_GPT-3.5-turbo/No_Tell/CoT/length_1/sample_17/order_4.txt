Story:
1 Mila, Liam, Emma, Alexander and Avery entered the patio.
2 The lettuce is in the blue_crate.
3 Mila made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.

13 Avery saw a mouse.
14 Avery exited the patio.
15 Mila, Liam, Emma, Alexander and Avery entered the waiting_room.
Question: Where does Avery think Mila thinks Emma thinks Liam thinks the lettuce is?
Answer: blue_crate
Choices: A. red_box, B. green_pantry, C. red_crate, D. blue_bathtub, E. blue_treasure_chest, F. blue_crate, G. red_pantry, H. green_crate, I. blue_container, J. green_cupboard, K. red_envelope, L. red_drawer, M. blue_drawer, N. red_bucket, O. red_container

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: blue_crate
GPT-4 Explain: To solve this question, we need to track the movements and actions of Mila, Liam, Emma, Alexander, and Avery. Mila, Liam, Emma, Alexander, and Avery entered the patio together. Mila made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. Liam made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. Emma made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. Alexander moved the lettuce to the blue_container before exiting. Avery made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting and seeing a mouse. Then, Mila, Liam, Emma, Alexander, and Avery entered the waiting_room together.

We don't have any information about Mila's thoughts on the lettuce, but we know that Avery saw the mouse in the patio. Therefore, Avery knows that the lettuce is not in the blue_container because Alexander moved it there before exiting. We also know that Avery did not see Mila, Liam, or Emma make any movements in the patio, so Avery does not have any information about their thoughts on the lettuce.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Mila thinks Emma thinks Liam thinks the lettuce is. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
