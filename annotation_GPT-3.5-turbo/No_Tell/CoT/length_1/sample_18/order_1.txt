Question: Where does Benjamin really think the corn is?
Answer: green_crate
Choices: A. blue_treasure_chest, B. green_crate, C. red_pantry, D. green_bathtub, E. blue_bathtub, F. red_basket, G. green_drawer, H. green_pantry, I. red_crate, J. red_drawer, K. green_treasure_chest, L. green_cupboard, M. red_container, N. green_bottle, O. blue_container

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_crate
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to look at the movements and actions of each character in the story. We know that the corn was initially in the blue_treasure_chest, but Charlotte moved it to the green_crate. Jackson, Avery, Liam, and Benjamin all entered the cellar, but only Jackson and Avery stayed for one minute without making any movements. All four characters then exited the cellar and later entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Benjamin can only infer the thoughts of other characters if he has been in the same place as them or has had private or public interactions with them. We also know that each character tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say to others.

Since Benjamin did not make any movements in the cellar and did not have any private or public interactions with Charlotte or Avery, he cannot be sure where the corn is. However, he may trust Avery's claim that he likes the blue_bathtub, which could lead him to believe that the corn is in the blue_container. Therefore, the answer is O. blue_container.
