Question: Where does Elizabeth think Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is?
Answer: green_envelope
Choices: A. green_cupboard, B. blue_bathtub, C. red_box, D. green_bucket, E. red_pantry, F. blue_bottle, G. green_envelope, H. green_basket, I. blue_cupboard, J. green_drawer, K. blue_bucket, L. red_basket, M. green_crate, N. blue_suitcase, O. green_bottle

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_envelope
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and the location of the banana. From the story, we know that the banana was initially in the green_envelope, then Abigail moved it to the blue_bottle, and finally, Owen moved it back to the green_envelope. Elizabeth was in the bedroom with the banana and made no movements, so she knows the banana was initially in the green_envelope. Ella also made no movements and stayed in the bedroom, so she knows the banana was in the green_envelope as well. Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle, but we don't know if Ella was present when this happened. Therefore, we cannot infer where Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is. Elizabeth only knows that the banana was initially in the green_envelope, so she cannot provide any insight into where Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is. The answer is unknown.
