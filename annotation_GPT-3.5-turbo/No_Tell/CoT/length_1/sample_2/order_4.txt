Read the following story and answer the multiple-choice question. Think step-by-step. Provide the answer first, and then explain it.
Story:
1 Isabella, Carter, Elizabeth, Hannah and Jacob entered the bedroom.
2 The tomato is in the green_bottle.
3 Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box.
4 Isabella exited the bedroom.
5 Carter made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
6 Carter exited the bedroom.
7 Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container.
8 Elizabeth exited the bedroom.

11 Hannah exited the bedroom.
12 Jacob made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
13 Jacob exited the bedroom.
14 Isabella, Carter, Elizabeth, Hannah and Jacob entered the waiting_room.
Question: Where does Elizabeth think Isabella thinks Hannah thinks Jacob thinks the tomato is?
Answer: green_box
Choices: A. green_bottle, B. red_basket, C. green_bucket, D. green_box, E. blue_container, F. red_drawer, G. blue_bucket, H. green_envelope, I. blue_bathtub, J. blue_crate, K. red_envelope, L. red_box, M. green_crate, N. green_basket, O. red_bucket

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
***Correct answer: green_box
GPT-4 Explain: This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container, so she knows where the tomato is.
2. Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box before leaving the bedroom, so she thinks the tomato is in the green_box.
3. Hannah made no movements in the bedroom, so she doesn't know where the tomato is.
4. Jacob lost his watch and made no movements in the bedroom, so he doesn't know where the tomato is.
5. We don't know what Carter thinks about the tomato's location, as he made no movements in the bedroom.

Based on these observations, we can start to infer what Elizabeth thinks Isabella thinks Hannah thinks Jacob thinks the tomato is. Here are the possibilities:

- If Elizabeth thinks Isabella knows where the tomato is (i.e. in the green_box), she might assume that Isabella thinks Hannah and Jacob also know where it is. Therefore, she might think that Isabella thinks Hannah and Jacob think the tomato is in the green_box.
- If Elizabeth thinks Isabella doesn't know where the tomato is (i.e. she left before Isabella moved it to the green_box), she might assume that Isabella thinks Hannah and Jacob also don't know where it is. Therefore, she might think that Isabella thinks Hannah and Jacob have no idea where the tomato is.

We don't have enough information to determine which of these possibilities is correct. However, we do know that Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container, so she might be biased towards thinking that the tomato is in the blue_container. Therefore, the most likely answer is E. blue_container.
