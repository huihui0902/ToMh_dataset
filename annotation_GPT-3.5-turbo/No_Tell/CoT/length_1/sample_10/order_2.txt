Question: Where does Nathan think William thinks the plum is?
Answer: red_pantry
Choices: A. red_drawer, B. green_bottle, C. blue_bathtub, D. blue_treasure_chest, E. red_box, F. green_crate, G. red_pantry, H. green_pantry, I. green_bucket, J. red_crate, K. green_envelope, L. green_drawer, M. blue_suitcase, N. green_box, O. red_envelope

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: red_pantry
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Nathan and William and the location of the plum. Nathan and William both entered the pantry and stayed there for 1 minute each. Evelyn moved the plum from the red_pantry to the green_bucket before exiting the pantry. Jacob moved the plum back to the red_pantry before exiting the pantry. Emily also entered the pantry but made no movements before exiting. Nathan saw a mouse and made no movements before exiting the pantry. Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exit the room later than themselves, Nathan would trust William's thoughts more than Emily's or Jacob's. 

Since William did not make any movements in the pantry, we cannot determine his thoughts based on his actions. However, we can infer his thoughts based on the actions of others and the location of the plum. Since Evelyn moved the plum to the green_bucket before exiting the pantry, William may think that the plum is in the green_bucket. However, Jacob moved the plum back to the red_pantry before exiting the pantry, so William may also think that the plum is in the red_pantry. 

Therefore, Nathan may think that William thinks the plum is either in the green_bucket or the red_pantry. The answer choices are locations, so the possible answers are G (red_pantry) or I (green_bucket). 

The answer is either G or I, depending on what William thinks.
