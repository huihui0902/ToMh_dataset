Read the following story and answer the multiple-choice question. Think step-by-step. Provide the answer first, and then explain it.
Story:
1 Owen, Ella, Chloe, Sophia and Noah entered the crawlspace.
2 The corn is in the green_crate.
3 Owen made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
4 Owen exited the crawlspace.
5 Ella made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
6 Ella exited the crawlspace.
7 Chloe made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
8 Ella dislikes the corn.
9 Chloe exited the crawlspace.
10 Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase.
11 Sophia exited the crawlspace.
12 Noah made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
13 Noah exited the crawlspace.
14 Owen, Ella, Chloe, Sophia and Noah entered the waiting_room.
Question: Where does Owen think Ella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is?
Answer: green_crate
Choices: A. red_crate, B. red_box, C. green_envelope, D. green_drawer, E. red_pantry, F. green_crate, G. blue_pantry, H. blue_bucket, I. red_drawer, J. blue_suitcase, K. blue_bathtub, L. red_container, M. green_box, N. green_bathtub, O. blue_crate

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_crate
GPT-4 Explain: This question requires a lot of logical reasoning and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Owen and the rest of the group entered the crawlspace.
2. The corn is in the green_crate.
3. Owen made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
4. Owen exited the crawlspace.
5. Ella made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
6. Ella exited the crawlspace.
7. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
8. Ella dislikes the corn.
9. Chloe exited the crawlspace.
10. Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase.
11. Sophia exited the crawlspace.
12. Noah made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
13. Noah exited the crawlspace.
14. Owen, Ella, Chloe, Sophia, and Noah entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Owen can only infer what Ella thinks if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We also know that Ella dislikes the corn, but we don't know if she shared this information with Owen.

Chloe made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute, so we don't know what she thinks about the corn. Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase, so we know that she thinks the corn is in the blue_suitcase.

Noah made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute, so we don't know what he thinks about the corn either.

Since we don't have any information about what Ella thinks about the corn, we can't infer what Chloe or Sophia think about it either. Therefore, we can't determine where Owen thinks Ella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is.

The answer is none of the above (N/A).
