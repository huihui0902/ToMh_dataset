Read the following story and answer the multiple-choice question. Think step-by-step. Provide the answer first, and then explain it.
Story:
1 Mila, Ava, Emily, Evelyn and Jacob entered the front_yard.
2 The watermelon is in the blue_cupboard.
3 Mila moved the watermelon to the red_box.
4 Mila exited the front_yard.
5 Ava moved the watermelon to the green_bottle.
6 Ava exited the front_yard.

10 Evelyn exited the front_yard.
11 Jacob made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.
12 Jacob exited the front_yard.
13 Mila, Ava, Emily, Evelyn and Jacob entered the waiting_room.
Question: Where does Evelyn think Emily thinks Jacob thinks Ava thinks the watermelon is?
Answer: green_bottle
Choices: A. blue_bathtub, B. blue_cupboard, C. blue_pantry, D. green_bottle, E. red_box, F. red_drawer, G. red_bucket, H. blue_suitcase, I. blue_bottle, J. green_treasure_chest, K. blue_drawer, L. green_basket, M. red_envelope, N. green_envelope, O. green_pantry

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_bottle
GPT-4 Explain: This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Evelyn think Emily thinks Jacob thinks Ava thinks the watermelon is?

2. We know that Mila moved the watermelon to the red_box, Ava moved it to the green_bottle, and Emily moved it to the blue_bathtub.

3. We also know that Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute, and Jacob made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute.

4. Mila, Ava, Emily, Evelyn, and Jacob all entered the waiting_room together.

5. Based on the assumptions given, we know that Evelyn can only infer Jacob's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions.

6. We also know that agents tend to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts.

7. Finally, we know that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves.

Based on this information, we can eliminate some of the answer choices. We know that the watermelon was not in the blue_cupboard, red_drawer, red_bucket, blue_suitcase, green_treasure_chest, blue_drawer, green_basket, red_envelope, green_envelope, or green_pantry, as these locations were not mentioned in the story.

We also know that Mila moved the watermelon to the red_box, so it cannot be in the blue_cupboard or green_bottle.

Therefore, the only possible answer is A. blue_bathtub. Evelyn may think that Emily thinks Jacob thinks Ava thinks the watermelon is in the blue_bathtub, based on the fact that Emily moved it there and Jacob and Ava did not move it again before leaving the front_yard.
