Read the following story and answer the multiple-choice question. Think step-by-step. Provide the answer first, and then explain it.
Story:
1 Ella, Aiden, Jack, Benjamin and Emma entered the attic.
2 The spinach is in the red_bottle.
3 Ella moved the spinach to the green_basket.
4 Ella exited the attic.
5 Aiden made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.

11 Benjamin exited the attic.
12 Emma made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.
13 Emma exited the attic.
14 Ella, Aiden, Jack, Benjamin and Emma entered the waiting_room.
Question: Where does Aiden think Ella thinks Emma thinks the spinach is?
Answer: green_basket
Choices: A. red_crate, B. red_drawer, C. green_drawer, D. green_treasure_chest, E. green_bathtub, F. green_envelope, G. red_bottle, H. green_basket, I. blue_bucket, J. green_cupboard, K. blue_bottle, L. blue_cupboard, M. red_pantry, N. red_envelope, O. green_box

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_basket
GPT-4 Explain: This question requires a lot of careful reading and tracking of each character's movements and statements. We know that Ella moved the spinach from the red bottle to the green basket, and Benjamin later moved it to the green envelope. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute, while Jack and Emma also stayed in the attic for 1 minute each. 

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Aiden can only infer Ella's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private/public interactions. We also know that agents tend to lie, so we can't trust what they say to each other. 

Since Aiden made no movements after Ella moved the spinach, he would not have seen where she put it. However, he knows that Benjamin moved it to the green envelope. We don't have any information about interactions between Aiden, Ella, and Emma, so we can't infer what Ella thinks Emma thinks about the spinach's location. 

Therefore, the answer is: we don't have enough information to answer this question.
