Question: Where does Noah really think the pear is?
Answer: blue_crate
Choices: A. red_pantry, B. green_drawer, C. blue_pantry, D. blue_bucket, E. green_box, F. green_bathtub, G. red_bottle, H. red_crate, I. red_envelope, J. blue_cupboard, K. blue_suitcase, L. blue_crate, M. green_crate, N. blue_drawer, O. green_basket

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: blue_crate
GPT-4 Explain: Step 1: Look for any information related to Noah's movements or actions regarding the pear.

Step 2: Trace the movements of the pear and see if Noah was present in any of those places.

Step 3: Use the assumption that agents tend to lie and that their claims don't reflect their actual thoughts.

Step 4: Use the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can see that Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase and then exited the playroom. Later, William moved the pear to the green_crate and then exited the playroom. Finally, Aiden moved the pear to the blue_crate and then exited the playroom. Noah was not present in any of these movements, so we cannot trust his claims about the pear's location. However, we do know that William exited the playroom after Noah, so if Noah were to trust anyone, it would be William. Therefore, we can conclude that Noah really thinks the pear is in the green_crate, which is where William moved it. The answer is B. green_drawer.
