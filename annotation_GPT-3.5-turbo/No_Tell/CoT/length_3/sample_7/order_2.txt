Question: Where does Logan think Evelyn thinks the watermelon is?
Answer: green_cupboard
Choices: A. green_box, B. blue_drawer, C. red_container, D. red_basket, E. blue_treasure_chest, F. green_drawer, G. blue_crate, H. green_pantry, I. blue_pantry, J. blue_bucket, K. red_pantry, L. green_cupboard, M. red_bottle, N. green_envelope, O. green_bottle

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_cupboard
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Logan and Evelyn and the location of the watermelon. According to the story, Evelyn entered the staircase with Logan, Chloe, Charlotte, and Mila. She made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute before exiting. Mila moved the watermelon to the green_cupboard before exiting the staircase. Later, Logan entered the staircase with Chloe, Charlotte, and Mila. He made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute before exiting. He then moved the watermelon to the red_bottle before exiting the staircase. Finally, Evelyn entered the waiting_room with Logan, Chloe, Charlotte, and Mila.

Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, Logan would trust Evelyn's knowledge of the watermelon's location since she exited the staircase before him. Therefore, Logan would think that Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the green_cupboard, where Mila had placed it before Logan moved it to the red_bottle. The answer is L. green_cupboard.
