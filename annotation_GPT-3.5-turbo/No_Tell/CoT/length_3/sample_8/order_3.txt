Question: Where does Jack think Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is?
Answer: blue_pantry
Choices: A. red_envelope, B. blue_bottle, C. green_bottle, D. green_pantry, E. green_crate, F. red_basket, G. green_cupboard, H. blue_treasure_chest, I. red_box, J. green_bucket, K. green_envelope, L. green_drawer, M. blue_crate, N. blue_pantry, O. green_basket

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: blue_pantry
GPT-4 Explain: To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the lemon and the agents' thoughts about its location. 

First, Jack moved the lemon from the green_drawer to the blue_pantry. Then, Liam moved it from the blue_pantry to the blue_crate. Aiden then moved it from the blue_crate to the green_basket. Finally, Nathan moved it from the green_basket to the green_drawer. 

We need to determine where Jack thinks Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is. Since Jack exited the garage before Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer, he does not know its current location. However, he knows that he likes the green_drawer, so he may assume that Nathan thinks Aiden put the lemon in the green_drawer. 

Therefore, the answer is L. green_drawer.
