Answer: red_basket
Choices: A. green_crate, B. green_drawer, C. blue_crate, D. blue_bathtub, E. green_pantry, F. green_box, G. blue_pantry, H. red_box, I. green_bucket, J. red_bucket, K. green_bottle, L. red_basket, M. blue_cupboard, N. red_crate, O. blue_bucket

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: red_basket
GPT-4 Explain: To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Ava and Amelia and the location of the tangerine. Ava entered the cellar with Sophia, Amelia, Abigail, and Carter. She made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. Amelia also made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. Sophia moved the tangerine from the red_basket to the green_bottle before exiting. Abigail moved the tangerine from the green_bottle to the red_crate before exiting. Finally, Carter moved the tangerine from the red_crate to the red_basket before exiting. 

We know that Ava dislikes corn, but we don't have any information about her thoughts on the tangerine's location. However, we do know that Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red_basket. Since Ava and Amelia were both in the cellar at the same time, Ava could infer Amelia's thoughts on the tangerine's location. 

Based on the movements of the tangerine and the agents, we know that the tangerine is in the red_basket, which is where Carter told Ava it was. Therefore, Ava would think that Amelia also thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket. 

The answer is L. red_basket.
