13 Benjamin, Jackson, Avery, Abigail and Mila entered the waiting_room.
14 Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate.
15 Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket.
Question: Where does Abigail think Mila thinks Benjamin thinks Jackson thinks the cherry is?
Answer: green_bucket
Choices: A. blue_bottle, B. blue_suitcase, C. green_cupboard, D. red_drawer, E. red_pantry, F. blue_cupboard, G. red_basket, H. green_envelope, I. blue_bathtub, J. red_bottle, K. blue_crate, L. green_bucket, M. green_bottle, N. green_treasure_chest, O. blue_container

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_bucket
GPT-4 Explain: This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Abigail thinks that the cherry is in the green_bucket, based on what Jackson told her.
2. Jackson told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket, but we don't know if he is telling the truth or lying.
3. Benjamin did not make any movements in the master_bedroom, so he did not see where the cherry is.
4. Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate, but we don't know if he is telling the truth or lying.
5. Mila did not make any movements in the master_bedroom, so she did not see where the cherry is.
6. Mila did not have any private or public interactions with Benjamin, so she does not know what he thinks about the cherry's location.
7. Abigail did not have any private or public interactions with Mila, so she does not know what Mila thinks about the cherry's location.
8. Abigail did not have any private or public interactions with Benjamin, so she does not know what he thinks about the cherry's location.
9. Jackson told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket, but we don't know if he is telling the truth or lying.
10. Based on assumption (4), Abigail tends to trust agents who exited the room later than herself. Mila exited the master_bedroom after Abigail, so Abigail may be more likely to trust Mila's thoughts about the cherry's location.

Putting all of this together, we can conclude that Abigail thinks Mila thinks Benjamin thinks the cherry is in the blue_crate (option K). This is based on the fact that Abigail trusts Mila's thoughts more than Benjamin's (since Mila exited the room after Abigail), and Avery told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate (although we don't know if this is true or false).
