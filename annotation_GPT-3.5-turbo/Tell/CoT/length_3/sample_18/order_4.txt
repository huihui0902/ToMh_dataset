Question: Where does William think Aiden thinks Avery thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is?
Answer: green_bucket
Choices: A. blue_crate, B. blue_cupboard, C. green_bottle, D. red_pantry, E. green_box, F. green_bucket, G. green_crate, H. green_basket, I. green_treasure_chest, J. green_envelope, K. blue_drawer, L. green_bathtub, M. red_container, N. green_pantry, O. red_bucket

Note: You should assume the following. (1) An agent witnesses everything and every movements before exiting a location. (2) An agent A can infer another agent B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have private or public interactions. (3) Note that every agent tend to lie. What a character tells others doesn't affect his actual belief. An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself. The exit order is known to all agents. (4) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but they know that anyone can hear any public claims.
Correct answer: green_bucket
GPT-4 Explain: Step 1: Identify the agents involved in the question - William, Aiden, Avery, and Carter.
Step 2: Determine the order of their exits from the office - Avery, Aiden, Carter, William.
Step 3: Determine the location of the cabbage - in the green_crate.
Step 4: Determine who knows the location of the cabbage - Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket, and William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate.
Step 5: Determine who trusts whom - William trusts Carter more than Avery, as Carter exited the office after William.

Based on the assumptions and the story, we can conclude that William thinks that Aiden thinks Avery thinks that the cabbage is in the green_basket. This is because Aiden publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the green_basket, and William trusts Carter more than Avery, so he would believe that Carter knows the true location of the cabbage. Avery made no movements in the office and did not have any private or public interactions that would suggest he knows the location of the cabbage. Therefore, William would not think that Avery knows the location of the cabbage.
