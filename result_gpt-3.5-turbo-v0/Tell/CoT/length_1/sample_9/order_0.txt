To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and their public and private claims. According to the story and assumptions, we know that Abigail, Owen, Amelia, Jack, and Aiden all entered the laundry together. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute before exiting. Owen moved the spinach from the blue suitcase to the red basket before exiting. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute before exiting. Jack moved the spinach from the red basket to the green pantry before exiting. Aiden moved the spinach from the green pantry to the blue suitcase before exiting. 

After leaving the laundry, all five agents entered the waiting room. Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red container, but we know that agents tend to lie and what they say doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue suitcase, which means that he knows where the spinach really is. 

Based on the movements of the agents, we can conclude that the spinach is in the blue suitcase (option F). Therefore, the answer is F.
