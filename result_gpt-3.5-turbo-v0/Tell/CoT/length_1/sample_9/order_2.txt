To answer this question, we need to track where the spinach was moved by each agent and who had interactions with whom. 

- Abigail entered the laundry and made no movements, so she did not move the spinach. 
- Owen moved the spinach from the blue suitcase to the red basket. 
- Amelia entered the laundry and made no movements, so she did not move the spinach. 
- Jack moved the spinach from the red basket to the green pantry. 
- Aiden moved the spinach from the green pantry to the blue suitcase. 

After all the agents exited the laundry, Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red container, but Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue suitcase. 

Since Owen moved the spinach to the red basket and did not have any interactions with Abigail, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is based on the given information. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
