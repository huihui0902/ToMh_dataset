This is a complex question that requires breaking down the thought process of each character. 

First, we need to determine where the spinach actually is. According to the story, Aiden moved the spinach to the blue suitcase. 

Next, we need to determine who knows where the spinach is. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue suitcase. Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red container. This means that Amelia is lying about the location of the spinach. 

Now, we need to determine what each character thinks about the location of the spinach. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute, so we don't know what she thinks. Owen moved the spinach to the red basket, so he knows that it's not in the blue suitcase. Jack moved the spinach to the green pantry, so he also knows that it's not in the blue suitcase. 

Finally, we need to determine where Jack thinks Aiden thinks Owen thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is. Since Jack knows that the spinach is not in the blue suitcase, he knows that Aiden must also know this. Therefore, Aiden cannot think that Abigail thinks the spinach is in the blue suitcase. Owen moved the spinach to the red basket, so he knows that it's not in the blue suitcase. Therefore, Owen cannot think that Abigail thinks the spinach is in the blue suitcase. Abigail made no movements, so we don't know what she thinks. Therefore, Jack must think that Aiden thinks that Abigail thinks the spinach is in the blue suitcase. 

The answer is F. blue suitcase.
