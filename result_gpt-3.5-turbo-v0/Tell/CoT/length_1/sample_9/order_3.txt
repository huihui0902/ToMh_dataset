To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of each agent and their interactions. 

1. Abigail, Owen, Amelia, Jack, and Aiden entered the laundry.
2. The spinach is in the blue_suitcase.
3. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
4. Abigail exited the laundry.
5. Owen moved the spinach to the red_basket.
6. Owen exited the laundry.
7. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute.
8. Amelia exited the laundry.
9. Jack moved the spinach to the green_pantry.
10. Abigail dislikes the lemon.
11. Jack exited the laundry.
12. Aiden moved the spinach to the blue_suitcase.
13. Aiden exited the laundry.
14. Abigail, Owen, Amelia, Jack, and Aiden entered the waiting_room.
15. Amelia publicly claimed that spinach is in the red_container.
16. Aiden privately told Amelia that the spinach is in the blue_suitcase.

Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, we know that Aiden trusts Amelia's claim that the spinach is in the red_container. However, we need to determine where Aiden thinks Owen thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is.

We know that Owen moved the spinach to the red_basket, but we don't know if he shared this information with anyone. Abigail made no movements and dislikes lemon, so we can assume she doesn't know where the spinach is. Jack moved the spinach to the green_pantry, so he knows where it is, but we don't know if he shared this information with anyone.

Therefore, the only information we have to go on is that the spinach is in the blue_suitcase, which Aiden knows. We also know that Aiden privately told Amelia this information. 

So, where does Aiden think Owen thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is? We don't have enough information to determine this. The answer cannot be determined from the given information.
