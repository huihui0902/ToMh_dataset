To answer this question, we need to track Abigail's movements and interactions with other agents. Abigail entered the laundry with Owen, Amelia, Jack, and Aiden. She made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute before exiting. During her time in the laundry, Owen moved the spinach to the red_basket, and Jack later moved it to the green_pantry. Abigail dislikes the lemon, but there is no mention of her having any interaction with the spinach. 

In the waiting_room, Amelia publicly claimed that the spinach is in the red_container, but Aiden privately told her that it is in the blue_suitcase. Abigail was present for both of these interactions, but there is no mention of her making any claims or having any private conversations about the spinach. 

Based on this information, we cannot determine where Abigail really thinks the spinach is. She did not interact with the spinach in the laundry, and there is no mention of her making any claims or having any private conversations about it in the waiting_room. Therefore, the answer is unknown and cannot be determined from the given information.
