To solve this question, we need to consider the private conversation between Liam and Avery. Liam told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle. However, we know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust Liam's statement. We also know that Avery made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, so she did not witness Liam moving the peach to the blue_treasure_chest. Therefore, we cannot assume that Avery knows the peach is in the blue_treasure_chest.

However, we do know that Benjamin privately told Hannah that the peach is in the red_envelope. Since Avery and Benjamin were both in the patio at the same time, Avery could have overheard Benjamin's statement. Therefore, we can assume that Avery thinks the peach is in the red_envelope.

The answer is M. red_envelope.
