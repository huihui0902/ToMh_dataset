To answer this question, we need to look at the actions and private interactions of Isla. Isla made no movements in the living_room and stayed there for 1 minute. Isla then exited the living_room and privately told Alexander that the lettuce is in the red_pantry. Isla did not have any private interactions with Sophia or Benjamin, so we cannot infer their thoughts. However, we know that Isla trusts Alexander more than Benjamin because Alexander exited the living_room after Benjamin. Therefore, we can assume that Isla's private claim to Alexander is more likely to be truthful. Based on this information, the answer is L. red_pantry.
