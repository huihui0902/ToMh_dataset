To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the green pepper and the private conversations between the agents. According to the story, Alexander moved the green pepper from the blue crate to the blue suitcase, and then Evelyn moved it from the blue suitcase to the blue treasure chest. Hannah, Abigail, and Noah made no movements and stayed in the den for one minute each. Then, all five agents entered the waiting room. 

In the waiting room, Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green pepper is in the green envelope, but we cannot trust this information as agents tend to lie. However, Hannah privately told Alexander that the green pepper is in the blue crate, which means that the green pepper is actually in the blue crate. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is G. blue crate.
