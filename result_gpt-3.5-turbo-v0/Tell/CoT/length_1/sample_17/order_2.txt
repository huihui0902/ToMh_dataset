To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the green pepper and the interactions between Evelyn and Alexander. 

According to the story, Alexander initially moved the green pepper from the green crate to the blue suitcase. Then, Evelyn moved the green pepper from the blue suitcase to the blue treasure chest. 

Later on, Hannah privately told Alexander that the green pepper is in the blue crate. However, we don't know if Alexander believed her or not. 

Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green pepper is in the green envelope. We don't know if Abigail believed her or not. 

We are asked where Evelyn thinks Alexander thinks the green pepper is. Based on the story, we don't have any direct information about what Evelyn thinks about Alexander's thoughts. However, we can make some inferences based on the assumptions given. 

Assumption (2) tells us that Evelyn can only infer Alexander's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We know that they were both in the den at the same time, but we don't have any information about any private or public interactions they had. 

Assumption (4) tells us that agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later than themselves. We know that Alexander exited the den before Evelyn did, so based on this assumption, Evelyn may be less likely to trust Alexander's thoughts about the green pepper. 

Based on the movements of the green pepper, it seems that Evelyn may think that Alexander thinks the green pepper is in the blue suitcase (where he initially moved it to). However, we can't say for certain since we don't have any direct information about what Evelyn thinks about Alexander's thoughts. 

Therefore, the answer is I. blue suitcase.
