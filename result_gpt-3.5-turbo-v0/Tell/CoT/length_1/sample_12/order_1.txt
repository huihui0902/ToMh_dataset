To solve this question, we need to follow the movements of each agent and their interactions. According to the story, Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava entered the front yard. Owen made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute before exiting. Logan moved the tangerine to the green box and then exited. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red basket and then exited. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute before exiting. Ava made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute before exiting. 

Then, all five agents entered the waiting room. Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate, but Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket. 

Based on this information, we can conclude that Ava knows the true location of the tangerine, and she told Elizabeth that it is in the red basket. Therefore, the answer is option O, red basket.
