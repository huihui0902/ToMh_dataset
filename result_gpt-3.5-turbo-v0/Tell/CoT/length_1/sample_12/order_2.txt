To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the tangerine and the agents' interactions. 

1. Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava entered the front yard.
2. The tangerine is in the red bottle.
3. Owen made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
4. Owen exited the front yard.
5. Logan moved the tangerine to the green box.
6. Logan exited the front yard.
7. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red basket.
8. Elizabeth exited the front yard.
9. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
10. Alexander exited the front yard.
11. Ava made no movements and stayed in the front yard for 1 minute.
12. Ava exited the front yard.
13. Owen, Logan, Elizabeth, Alexander, and Ava entered the waiting room.
14. Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate.
15. Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket.

Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Logan moved the tangerine to the green box and then exited the front yard. Logan did not have any interactions with Ava, so he does not know where Ava thinks the tangerine is. However, Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket. Therefore, Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red basket. 

The answer to the question is O. red basket.
