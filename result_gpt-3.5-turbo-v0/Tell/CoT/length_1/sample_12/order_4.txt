This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Elizabeth think the tangerine is?
- Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue_crate.

2. Where does Ava think the tangerine is?
- Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket.

3. Where does Elizabeth think Ava thinks the tangerine is?
- We don't have any information about this. Elizabeth may or may not trust Ava's claim, and we don't know if they had any private interactions that would give Elizabeth more information.

4. Where does Logan think the tangerine is?
- Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box. We don't know if Logan made any public or private claims about the tangerine's location.

5. Where does Owen think Logan thinks the tangerine is?
- Owen made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute, so he didn't see where the tangerine was moved. We don't have any information about Owen's thoughts on the matter.

6. Where does Elizabeth think Owen thinks Logan thinks the tangerine is?
- This is the key part of the question. We know that Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue_crate, but we don't know if she trusts her own claim or if she has any reason to doubt it. We also don't know if Owen and Logan had any private or public interactions that would give Elizabeth more information about their thoughts. However, we do know that Owen exited the front_yard before Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box, so Elizabeth may assume that Owen thinks the tangerine is still in the front_yard. Therefore, Elizabeth may think that Owen thinks Logan thinks the tangerine is in the green_box.

Based on this analysis, the answer is N. green_box.
