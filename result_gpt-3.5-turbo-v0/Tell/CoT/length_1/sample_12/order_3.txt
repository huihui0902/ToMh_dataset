This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Owen think Logan thinks the tangerine is?
- We know that Owen did not move the tangerine and did not publicly claim where it is.
- Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box and then exited the front_yard.
- Therefore, Owen knows that Logan thinks the tangerine is in the green_box.

2. Where does Ava think the tangerine is?
- We don't know for sure where Ava thinks the tangerine is, but we do know that she privately told Elizabeth that it is in the red_basket.

3. Where does Owen think Ava thinks the tangerine is?
- To answer this question, we need to consider the exit order and the private communication between Ava and Elizabeth.
- Owen exited the front_yard before Ava, so he would tend to trust her more than Logan or Elizabeth.
- Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket, so Owen would know that Ava thinks it is there.
- Therefore, Owen thinks that Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.

4. Where does Owen think Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is?
- To answer this question, we need to combine the previous two answers.
- Owen thinks that Logan thinks the tangerine is in the green_box.
- Owen thinks that Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.
- Therefore, Owen thinks that Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is NOT in the green_box (since Ava privately told Elizabeth that it is in the red_basket).

Based on this analysis, the answer is NOT N. green_box. Therefore, we can eliminate options N, K, and L. We also know that Owen thinks the tangerine is NOT in the green_box, so we can eliminate options D and F. Finally, we know that Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket, so the answer must be O. red_basket. Therefore, the answer is O. red_basket.
