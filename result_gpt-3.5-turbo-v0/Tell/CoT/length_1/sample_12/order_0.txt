To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and their interactions. 

- Owen entered the front yard, made no movements, and exited.
- Logan entered the front yard, moved the tangerine to the green box, and exited.
- Elizabeth entered the front yard, moved the tangerine to the red basket, and exited.
- Alexander entered the front yard, made no movements, and exited.
- Ava entered the front yard, made no movements, and exited.
- Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate.
- Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red basket.

Based on the above information, we can eliminate some options. The tangerine is not in the blue crate because Elizabeth lied about it. The tangerine is not in the green crate or the green box because Logan and Elizabeth moved it from there. The tangerine is not in the red drawer, red bucket, blue drawer, green drawer, green bucket, red pantry, green envelope, blue pantry, blue treasure chest, or red container because there is no mention of it being there.

Therefore, the tangerine is either in the red bottle, red basket, or red pantry. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red basket, but Ava privately told her that it is in the red basket. We know that Ava tends to lie, but we don't know if she lied in this case. However, we do know that Elizabeth publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the blue crate, which we know is a lie. Therefore, we can assume that Elizabeth is also lying about the tangerine being in the red basket. 

This leaves us with the option of the tangerine being in the red bottle or the red pantry. Since there is no mention of the tangerine being moved to the red pantry, the answer is most likely the red bottle. 

Therefore, the answer is K. red bottle.
