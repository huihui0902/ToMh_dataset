To solve this question, we need to track the movements and private interactions of each agent. According to the story, Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket. However, we know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust this information. We also know that Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate. Since Avery exited the master_bedroom after Jackson, Benjamin can trust Avery more than Jackson. Therefore, we can assume that the cherry is in the blue_crate. The answer is option K.
