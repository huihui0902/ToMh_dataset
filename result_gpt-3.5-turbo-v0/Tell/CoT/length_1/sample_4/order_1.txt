To solve this question, we need to follow the movements and private interactions of Jackson. According to the story, Jackson entered the master_bedroom with Benjamin, Avery, Abigail, and Mila. He made no movements and stayed in the room for 1 minute before exiting. Then, he entered the waiting_room with the others. 

In the waiting_room, Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate, but we don't know if Jackson overheard this conversation. However, we do know that Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket. 

Based on assumption (3), we know that what Jackson tells Abigail doesn't necessarily reflect his actual thought. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Jackson really thinks the cherry is in the green_bucket. 

However, based on assumption (4), we know that Jackson tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself. Since Abigail exited the master_bedroom after Jackson, he may be more likely to trust her. Therefore, we can infer that Jackson may think the cherry is in the green_bucket, which is what he told Abigail privately.

Therefore, the answer is L. green_bucket.
