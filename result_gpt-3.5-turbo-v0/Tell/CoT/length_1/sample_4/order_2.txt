To answer this question, we need to track the movements and private interactions of Benjamin and Jackson. We know that both Benjamin and Jackson entered the master_bedroom and stayed there for 1 minute without making any movements. Then, they both exited the room. After that, they both entered the waiting_room where Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate and Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket. 

Based on the assumption that an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself, we can assume that Benjamin trusts Jackson more than Abigail. Therefore, Benjamin is more likely to believe Jackson's claim about the location of the cherry. 

According to Jackson's private claim, the cherry is in the green_bucket, which is option L. Therefore, the answer is L.
