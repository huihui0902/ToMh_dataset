This question requires a bit of deduction and inference based on the given assumptions. We need to track the movements and private conversations of the agents to determine where Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is.

First, we know that Benjamin was told by Chloe that the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest. However, we cannot trust this information as Chloe may be lying.

Next, Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. Again, we cannot trust this information as Amelia may be lying.

We also know that Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the green_treasure_chest after Benjamin moved it to the blue_pantry. This suggests that Elizabeth may believe the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest.

Finally, we need to determine where Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is. We know that Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. However, we cannot trust this information as Amelia may be lying. Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is.

Based on the given information, we can only conclude that Elizabeth thinks the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest. Therefore, the answer is (K) green_treasure_chest.
