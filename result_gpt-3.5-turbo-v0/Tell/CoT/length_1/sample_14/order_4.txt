This question requires a lot of steps to solve. Let's break it down:

1. Chloe privately told Benjamin that the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest.
2. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the green_treasure_chest.
3. Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box.
4. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute.
5. Chloe exited the attic later than Amelia and Benjamin.

Based on assumption (4), Chloe trusts Benjamin more than Amelia. Therefore, Chloe believes that the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest (from what Benjamin told her) and not in the red_box (from what Amelia told Mila). 

Now, we need to determine where Elizabeth thinks the tangerine is. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the green_treasure_chest, so she definitely thinks it's there. We don't have any information about Elizabeth's thoughts on where the other characters think the tangerine is.

Next, we need to determine where Amelia thinks the tangerine is. Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. We don't have any information about Amelia's thoughts on where the other characters think the tangerine is.

Finally, we need to determine where Mila thinks the tangerine is. We don't have any direct information about Mila's thoughts on the location of the tangerine. However, we know that Mila was in the attic with the tangerine for one minute and made no movements. This could suggest that she was observing the tangerine and its location, but we can't be sure.

Putting all of this together, we can conclude that Chloe thinks Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest (option K).
