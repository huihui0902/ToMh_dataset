To answer this question, we need to track the movements and private interactions of Mila and Amelia. Mila did not move in the attic and exited first, while Amelia stayed in the attic for a minute before exiting. In the waiting room, Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. However, we need to determine where Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is.

Based on the story, there is no indication that Mila shared her thoughts on the location of the tangerine with Amelia. Therefore, Amelia's assumption about Mila's thoughts on the tangerine's location is purely speculative. We cannot determine where Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is based on the given information.

The answer is not provided in the options given.
