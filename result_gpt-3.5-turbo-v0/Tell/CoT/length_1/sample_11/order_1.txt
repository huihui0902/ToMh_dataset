To answer this question, we need to consider the actions and interactions of the agents in the story. Sophia privately told Isabella that the pear is in the blue_crate. However, we also know that the agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust Sophia's statement. We need to look for other clues.

Ava moved the pear to the green_envelope before exiting the lounge, and Isabella publicly claimed that the pear is in the green_envelope after they entered the waiting_room. This suggests that the pear is indeed in the green_envelope, and Isabella may have seen Ava move it there.

Therefore, Sophia's real thought about the location of the pear is likely to be in the green_envelope. The answer is I. green_envelope.
