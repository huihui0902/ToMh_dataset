To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Ava and Sophia and their interactions with other agents. Ava moved the pear from the blue_crate to the green_envelope and then exited the lounge. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the lounge for 1 minute before exiting. Later, in the waiting_room, Isabella publicly claimed that the pear is in the green_envelope, while Sophia privately told Isabella that the pear is in the blue_crate.

Since Ava exited the lounge before Sophia, she would tend to trust Sophia's claim more than Isabella's claim. Therefore, Ava would think that Sophia thinks the pear is in the blue_crate, which is Sophia's private claim. The answer is F. blue_crate.
