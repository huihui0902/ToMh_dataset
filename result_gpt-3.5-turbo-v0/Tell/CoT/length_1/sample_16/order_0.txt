To solve this question, we need to follow the movements of the agents and their private interactions. 

1. Aiden and Isla entered the closet together. Aiden made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting. Isla also made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting. We don't know if they had any private interactions or not.

2. Carter moved the tomato from the red_crate to the blue_container. We don't know if anyone saw him do this or not.

3. Jack moved the tomato from the blue_container to the green_box. We don't know if anyone saw him do this or not.

4. Evelyn moved the tomato from the green_box to the red_crate. We don't know if anyone saw her do this or not.

5. All five agents entered the waiting_room together. Carter privately told Aiden that the tomato is in the green_box. Isla privately told Jack that the tomato is in the green_basket. We don't know if anyone else heard these private interactions or not.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the tomato is in the green_box. This is because Carter told Aiden that the tomato is in the green_box, and Aiden would trust Carter because he exited the closet after Carter did. Additionally, Isla told Jack that the tomato is in the green_basket, but we don't have any reason to trust Isla's word since she could be lying. Therefore, the correct answer is M. green_box.
