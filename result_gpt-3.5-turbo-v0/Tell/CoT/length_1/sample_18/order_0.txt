To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the cabbage and the statements made by the agents. According to the story, the cabbage was initially in the red_bucket in the master_bedroom. Logan moved it to the green_pantry and then Nathan moved it to the red_box. Isabella publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the red_box, but William privately told her that it is in the green_cupboard. However, we cannot trust what any agent says, so we need to rely on their movements.

After the cabbage was moved to the red_box by Nathan, Isabella and Aiden stayed in the master_bedroom for a minute without making any movements. William also stayed in the master_bedroom for a minute without making any movements. Logan exited the master_bedroom before anyone else.

Based on the assumption that an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself, we can assume that William trusts Logan the most, followed by Aiden, Isabella, and Nathan. Therefore, we can eliminate any options that were not mentioned by Logan or William.

Since Logan moved the cabbage to the green_pantry and William privately told Isabella that it is in the green_cupboard, we can conclude that the cabbage is most likely in the green_cupboard. Therefore, the answer is E. green_cupboard.
