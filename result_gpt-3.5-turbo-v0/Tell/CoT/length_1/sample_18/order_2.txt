To answer this question, we need to track the movements and interactions of Nathan and William regarding the cabbage. According to the story, Nathan moved the cabbage to the red_box and then exited the master_bedroom. William lost his gloves in the master_bedroom, made no movements for a minute, and then exited the master_bedroom. Later, in the waiting_room, Isabella publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the red_box, but William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

Based on these movements and interactions, we can infer that Nathan and William were both in the master_bedroom at the same time, but there is no evidence that they had any private or public interactions there. Therefore, Nathan cannot directly infer what William thinks about the cabbage.

However, we know that William privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard. Since Nathan exited the master_bedroom after William, he may trust William's word more than Isabella's public claim. Therefore, Nathan may think that William thinks the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

The correct answer is E. green_cupboard.
