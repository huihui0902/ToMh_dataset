To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the potato and the agents. According to the story, the potato was initially in the blue_bathtub, then moved to the blue_pantry by Avery, and then to the green_cupboard by Jacob. 

Later, Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub, but Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle. We need to consider that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust Jacob's public claim. 

However, we can infer that Alexander knows the location of the potato since he privately told Jacob that it is in the blue_bottle. We also know that Alexander stayed in the study for one minute, which means he had the opportunity to move the potato. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C. blue_bottle.
