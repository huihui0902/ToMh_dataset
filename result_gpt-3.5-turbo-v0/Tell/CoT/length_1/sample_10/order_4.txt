This question requires a lot of logical reasoning and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Jackson think Alexander thinks Jacob thinks the potato is?
We need to start from the innermost layer of the question and work our way out. So, let's start with "Carter thinks the potato is in the..." and work our way outwards.

2. Jacob publicly claimed that potato is in the blue_bathtub.
This means that Jacob wants everyone to believe that the potato is in the blue_bathtub. However, we don't know if this is true or false.

3. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle.
This means that Alexander knows where the potato actually is, but he only told Jacob in private. We don't know if Jacob believes Alexander or not.

4. Where does Alexander think Jacob thinks the potato is?
Since Alexander privately told Jacob where the potato is, we can assume that Alexander thinks Jacob knows where the potato is. However, we don't know if Alexander thinks Jacob is telling the truth or not.

5. Where does Jackson think Alexander thinks Jacob thinks the potato is?
This is where it gets tricky. We don't have any direct information about what Jackson thinks, but we can make some assumptions based on the given information. We know that Jackson made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute, and he exited the study after Alexander. We also know that agents tend to trust agents who exited the room later than themselves.

Based on this information, we can assume that Jackson trusts Alexander more than Jacob. Therefore, he might believe that Alexander is telling the truth about the potato being in the blue_bottle, and that Jacob is lying about it being in the blue_bathtub. However, we still don't know where Jackson thinks the potato actually is.

6. Where does Carter think the potato is?
We don't have any direct information about where Carter thinks the potato is, but we do know that he made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute. Therefore, he might have seen where the potato was originally placed (in the blue_bathtub) before Avery moved it to the blue_pantry.

7. Where does Avery think the potato is?
We know that Avery moved the potato from the blue_bathtub to the blue_pantry, so we can assume that he thinks the potato is in the blue_pantry.

8. Where does Jacob think the potato is?
Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub, but we don't know if he actually believes this or not. We do know that Alexander privately told him that the potato is in the blue_bottle, so he might be unsure about where the potato actually is.

9. Where does Alexander think the potato is?
We know that Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle, so we can assume that he thinks the potato is in the blue_bottle.

Based on all of this information, we can eliminate all of the answer choices except for C (blue_bottle) and A (blue_bathtub). Jackson might believe that Alexander is telling the truth about the potato being in the blue_bottle, but he might also believe that Carter saw the potato in the blue_bathtub before it was moved. Therefore, we can't be sure where Jackson thinks the potato is. However, we do know that Alexander thinks the potato is in the blue_bottle, so that is the answer to the question. 

Therefore, the answer is C. blue_bottle.
