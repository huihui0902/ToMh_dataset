This question requires a bit of deduction and inference based on the given assumptions. We know that Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle. However, Jacob publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue_bathtub. This means that Jacob is lying about the location of the potato. 

Now, we need to figure out where Alexander thinks Jacob thinks Carter thinks the potato is. Since Jacob is lying about the location of the potato, we cannot assume that he actually thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub. However, we do know that Jacob moved the potato to the green_cupboard before leaving the study. 

Since Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle, we can assume that Alexander thinks Jacob actually believes the potato is in the blue_bottle. Therefore, Alexander would think that Jacob thinks Carter thinks the potato is in the green_cupboard (since that is where Jacob moved the potato to). 

The answer is D. green_drawer.
