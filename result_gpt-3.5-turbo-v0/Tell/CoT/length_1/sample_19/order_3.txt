The question is asking for Ella's belief about Lily's belief about Logan's belief about the location of the green pepper. To solve this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their public and private claims.

1. Abigail, Lily, Ella, Logan, and Elizabeth entered the den.
2. The green pepper is in the red drawer.
3. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
4. Abigail exited the den.
5. Lily made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
6. Lily exited the den.
7. Ella made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
8. Ella exited the den.
9. Logan moved the green pepper to the blue crate.
10. Logan exited the den.
11. Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
12. Elizabeth exited the den.
13. Abigail, Lily, Ella, Logan, and Elizabeth entered the waiting room.
14. Ella publicly claimed that the green pepper is in the red pantry.
15. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green pepper is in the red drawer.

Based on the above information, we know that Logan moved the green pepper to the blue crate before exiting the den. However, we don't know if any of the other agents saw him do this or if they have any knowledge of the green pepper's location.

Ella publicly claimed that the green pepper is in the red pantry, but we don't know if she actually believes this or if she is lying. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green pepper is in the red drawer, so Ella knows the true location of the green pepper.

We don't have any information about Lily's knowledge of the green pepper's location or her movements after exiting the den. Therefore, we cannot determine where Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green pepper is.

The answer is unknown.
