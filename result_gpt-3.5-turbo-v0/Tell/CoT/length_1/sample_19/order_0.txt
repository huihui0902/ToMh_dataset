To solve this question, we need to follow the movements of each agent and their interactions. 

1. Abigail, Lily, Ella, Logan, and Elizabeth entered the den.
2. The green_pepper is in the red_drawer.
3. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
4. Abigail exited the den.
5. Lily made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
6. Lily exited the den.
7. Ella made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
8. Ella exited the den.
9. Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate.
10. Logan exited the den.
11. Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
12. Elizabeth exited the den.
13. Abigail, Lily, Ella, Logan, and Elizabeth entered the waiting_room.
14. Ella publicly claimed that green_pepper is in the red_pantry.
15. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green_pepper is in the red_drawer.

Based on the interactions, we know that Ella lied about the location of the green_pepper, as Elizabeth privately told her that it is in the red_drawer. We also know that Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D. blue_crate.
