To answer this question, we need to follow Logan's movements and interactions with other agents. Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate and then exited the den. After that, Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green_pepper is in the red_drawer. However, we don't know if Logan overheard this conversation or not. Based on the given information, we can assume that Logan tends to lie like other agents. Therefore, we cannot trust his public claims. We also don't know if Logan had any private interactions with other agents. So, the only reliable information we have is that Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate. Therefore, the answer is D. blue_crate.
