This question requires a bit of logic and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green_pepper is in the red_drawer.
2. Ella publicly claimed that green_pepper is in the red_pantry.
3. Lily made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute.
4. Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate.

Based on these steps, we can infer that Elizabeth knows the true location of the green_pepper (in the red_drawer) and that Ella is lying about its location (claiming it's in the red_pantry). We also know that Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate, so we can eliminate any options that don't involve the blue_crate.

Now we need to figure out where Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green_pepper is. Since Ella is lying about the location, we can't trust her claim that it's in the red_pantry. We also know that Lily didn't move the green_pepper, so she doesn't have any special knowledge about its location. That leaves us with Logan and his movement of the green_pepper to the blue_crate.

Since Elizabeth knows the true location of the green_pepper and that Logan moved it to the blue_crate, she may assume that Ella is trying to throw others off the trail by claiming it's in the red_pantry. Therefore, Elizabeth may think that Ella thinks Logan thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_crate.

So the answer is D. blue_crate.
