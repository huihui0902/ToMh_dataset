This question requires a bit of deduction and inference. We need to start with Liam's private conversation with Noah, where he tells him that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest. From this, we can infer that Liam knows where the lemon is. 

Next, we need to consider Avery's private conversation with Abigail, where he tells him that the lemon is in the green_drawer. We don't know if Avery is lying or telling the truth, but we do know that Liam was not present for this conversation, so he does not know where Avery thinks the lemon is. 

Finally, we need to consider where Lily thinks the lemon is. We know that Abigail moved the lemon to the blue_treasure_chest, but we don't know if Lily knows this. We also know that Avery moved the lemon to the blue_pantry, but we don't know if Lily knows this either. 

However, we do know that Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub. We also know that Liam was present when Lily entered the garage and when she exited, so he knows that Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub. 

Putting all of this together, we can infer that Liam thinks Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is in the blue_bathtub. Therefore, the answer is A. blue_bathtub.
