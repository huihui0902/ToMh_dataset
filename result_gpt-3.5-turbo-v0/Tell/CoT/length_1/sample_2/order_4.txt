This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Noah thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest (according to Liam's private message to him).
2. Liam thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest (according to his private message to Noah).
3. Avery thinks the lemon is in the green_drawer (according to his private message to Abigail).
4. Abigail lost his watch and did not receive any private messages about the lemon's location.
5. Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub, but we are not asked about her thoughts.

So, we need to determine where Noah thinks Liam thinks Avery thinks the lemon is. Based on the information we have, we know that Liam thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest, and Avery thinks the lemon is in the green_drawer. However, we don't know where Liam thinks Avery thinks the lemon is.

We can make some assumptions based on the given information. Since Liam did not move the lemon and stayed in the garage for 1 minute, he may not have seen Avery move the lemon to the blue_pantry. Therefore, he may still think the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest. However, we cannot be certain.

Noah, on the other hand, received a private message from Liam stating that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest. Therefore, he may also think that Avery thinks the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest, since he has no reason to doubt Liam's message.

Based on this analysis, the answer is E. blue_treasure_chest.
