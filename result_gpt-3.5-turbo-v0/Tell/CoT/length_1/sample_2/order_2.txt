To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the lemon and the agents' interactions. Here are the steps to solve the question:

1. Abigail, Liam, Avery, Noah, and Lily entered the garage.
2. The lemon is in the blue_bathtub.
3. Abigail moved the lemon to the blue_treasure_chest.
4. Lily dislikes the cabbage.
5. Abigail exited the garage.
6. Liam made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute.
7. Liam exited the garage.
8. Avery moved the lemon to the blue_pantry.
9. Avery exited the garage.
10. Noah made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute.
11. Noah exited the garage.
12. Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub.
13. Lily exited the garage.

Based on the above steps, we know that Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub before exiting the garage. However, we don't know if Avery witnessed this movement or not. We only know that Avery moved the lemon to the blue_pantry after Abigail moved it to the blue_treasure_chest.

Next, we need to consider the private interaction between Avery and Abigail. Avery told Abigail that the lemon is in the green_drawer. However, we know that Avery moved the lemon to the blue_pantry, not the green_drawer. This means that Avery lied to Abigail.

Since we don't have any information about Avery's private or public interactions with Lily, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Lily thinks the lemon is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given options.
