To answer this question, we need to follow Lily's movements with the lemon. According to the story, Lily moved the lemon to the blue bathtub (step 3), then later moved it to the blue pantry (step 12). We also know that Avery privately told Abigail that the lemon is in the green drawer (step 16), but we cannot assume that this is true since agents tend to lie. Therefore, Lily's actual thought about the lemon's location is either the blue bathtub or the blue pantry. The answer is A. blue_bathtub.
