To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the lemon and the private conversations between the agents. According to the story, Abigail moved the lemon from the blue_bathtub to the blue_treasure_chest, then Avery moved it to the blue_pantry, and finally Lily moved it back to the blue_bathtub. Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest, but we know that Liam tends to lie. Avery privately told Abigail that the lemon is in the green_drawer, but we don't know if Avery is telling the truth or lying. Therefore, we cannot trust Avery's claim. Based on the movements of the lemon, the correct answer is A. blue_bathtub.
