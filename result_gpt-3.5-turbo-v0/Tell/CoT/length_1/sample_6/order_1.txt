To answer this question, we need to consider the private conversation between Jacob and William. Jacob told William that the watermelon is in the green_envelope, but we know from the story that Jacob moved the watermelon to the green_bucket before he left the sunroom. Therefore, Jacob lied to William about the location of the watermelon. We also know that Emma privately told Owen that the watermelon is in the green_bucket, which is the true location of the watermelon. Since William exited the sunroom after Jacob, he would tend to trust Jacob's claim less than Emma's claim. Therefore, William really thinks that the watermelon is in the green_bucket. The answer is D. green_bucket.
