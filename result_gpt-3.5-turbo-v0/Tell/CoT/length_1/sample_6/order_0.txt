To solve this question, we need to follow the movements of the watermelon and the private conversations between the agents. 

1. Owen moved the watermelon to the green_envelope. 
2. Jacob moved the watermelon to the green_bucket. 
3. Emma moved the watermelon to the blue_pantry. 
4. William moved the watermelon to the green_basket. 

After all the agents exited the sunroom, Emma privately told Owen that the watermelon is in the green_bucket, and Jacob privately told William that the watermelon is in the green_envelope. 

We know that every agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust their public claims. However, we can use the exit order to determine who to trust. William exited the sunroom after Jacob, so we can trust his private conversation with Jacob. Therefore, we know that the watermelon is in the green_envelope. 

The answer is B. green_envelope.
