The question is asking about Liam's thoughts on where Emma thinks the tomato is. To answer this question, we need to track Emma's movements and interactions with other agents. Emma saw a cat and made no movements in the study for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, she did not move the tomato to the green_drawer. Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer and then exited the study. Nathan publicly claimed that the tomato is in the blue_bottle, but we know that Nathan tends to lie. Carter privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer, but we don't know if Emma believes him or not. 

Since Emma did not move the tomato and Liam moved it to the green_drawer, it is likely that Liam thinks Emma believes the tomato is in the green_drawer. Therefore, the answer is N. green_drawer.
