To solve this question, we need to track the movements and statements of each agent regarding the tomato's location. 

- Emma saw a cat and made no movements in the study.
- Hannah made no movements in the study.
- Carter dislikes the banana and made no movements in the study.
- Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer and then exited the study.
- Nathan made no movements in the study and publicly claimed that the tomato is in the blue_bottle.
- Carter privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer.

Based on this information, we can eliminate some options. The tomato cannot be in the blue_bathtub, red_drawer, green_bathtub, green_envelope, blue_cupboard, green_box, blue_treasure_chest, red_bottle, green_pantry, green_bucket, or blue_drawer because there is no mention of these locations in the story.

The tomato could be in the red_container or the green_drawer. Nathan publicly claimed that the tomato is in the blue_bottle, but we know that agents tend to lie. Carter privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer, but we don't know if Carter is telling the truth or lying.

However, we can use the assumption that agents tend to trust agents who exited the room later than themselves. Liam exited the study after Carter, Nathan, Hannah, and Emma. Therefore, Liam is the last agent to exit the study and the other agents may trust him more. Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer before exiting the study. Therefore, the tomato is most likely in the green_drawer.

The answer is N. green_drawer.
