To answer this question, we need to track the movements and interactions of Hannah, Liam, and Emma regarding the tomato. 

- Emma saw the cat and made no movements in the study. 
- Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer and then exited the study. 
- Hannah made no movements in the study. 
- Nathan made no movements in the study. 
- Carter made no movements in the study and privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer. 

Since Hannah made no movements in the study, she doesn't have any direct knowledge of where the tomato is. However, she knows that Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer and that Carter told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer. 

Therefore, Hannah thinks that Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is in the green_drawer. 

The answer is N. green_drawer.
