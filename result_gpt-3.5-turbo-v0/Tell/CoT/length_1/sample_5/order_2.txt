To answer this question, we need to track the movements and interactions of Sophia and Logan. We know that Sophia publicly claimed that the asparagus is in the red_crate, but we also know that Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. Since Logan saw a dog and exited the garage before Sophia made her claim, we can assume that Logan is the agent that Sophia trusts the most based on assumption (4). Therefore, Sophia likely thinks that Logan thinks the asparagus is in the blue_drawer, which is option L. So the answer is L.
