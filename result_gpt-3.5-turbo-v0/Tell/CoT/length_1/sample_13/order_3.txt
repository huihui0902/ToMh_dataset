To answer this question, we need to track the movements and private interactions of Liam, Elizabeth, and Owen regarding the onion's location. 

- Liam made no movements in the cellar and exited after Noah. 
- Elizabeth moved the onion from the red_crate to the green_bucket and exited before Owen. 
- Owen moved the onion from the green_bucket to the red_crate and exited last. 

We also know that Liam privately told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket, and Jack privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the red_crate. 

Based on this information, we can infer that Liam knows the onion was in the green_bucket when he left the cellar. He also knows that Elizabeth was in the cellar before Owen, so she must have seen the onion in the green_bucket before it was moved to the red_crate. However, Liam cannot be sure what Owen thinks about the onion's location because he did not have any private interactions with Owen. 

Therefore, Liam thinks Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is in the green_bucket. The answer is E. green_bucket.
