To solve this question, we need to track the movements and private interactions of the agents to determine where each agent thinks the onion is located. 

- Noah made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. He did not have any private interactions with Liam or Elizabeth. Therefore, we do not have any information about where he thinks the onion is located. 

- Liam made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. He privately told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket. Therefore, we know that Liam thinks the onion is in the green_bucket. 

- Elizabeth moved the onion to the green_bucket before exiting the cellar. She privately talked to Jack, who told her that the onion is in the red_crate. Therefore, we know that Elizabeth knows the onion is not in the green_bucket and thinks it is in the red_crate. 

- Owen moved the onion to the red_crate before exiting the cellar. We do not have any information about his private interactions or thoughts. 

Based on this information, we can determine that: 

- Liam thinks the onion is in the green_bucket. 
- Elizabeth thinks the onion is in the red_crate. 
- Owen's thoughts are unknown. 
- Noah's thoughts are unknown. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is not determinable based on the given information.
