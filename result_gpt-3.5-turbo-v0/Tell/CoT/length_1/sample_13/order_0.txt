To solve this question, we need to track the movements and statements of each agent regarding the onion's location. 

- Elizabeth moved the onion to the green_bucket.
- Owen moved the onion to the red_crate.
- Jack privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the red_crate.
- Liam privately told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket.

From these statements, we can conclude that the onion is actually in the green_bucket, as Liam's statement to Noah confirms Elizabeth's action of moving the onion to the green_bucket. Jack's statement to Elizabeth is a lie, as he dislikes the tomato and may have wanted to mislead her. 

Therefore, the answer is E. green_bucket.
