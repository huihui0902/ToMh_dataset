To answer this question, we need to determine where Amelia was when the tangerine was moved and if she had any interactions with other agents who may have given her information about the tangerine's location. According to the story, Amelia stayed in the cellar for 1 minute and made no movements, so she did not move the tangerine herself. Sophia moved the tangerine to the green bottle and Abigail later claimed that the tangerine was in the green bottle. However, we do not know if Amelia was present when Abigail made this claim or if she had any private interactions with Carter who told Ava that the tangerine was in the red basket. Therefore, we cannot determine with certainty where Amelia thinks the tangerine is. The answer is unknown.
