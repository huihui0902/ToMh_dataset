To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the tangerine and the statements made by the agents. According to the story, the tangerine was initially in the red_basket (step 2). Sophia moved it to the green_bottle (step 5), and then Abigail moved it to the red_crate (step 9), and finally, Carter moved it back to the red_basket (step 11). Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green_bottle (step 15), but we know that agents tend to lie. Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red_basket (step 16).

Based on this information, we can conclude that the tangerine is actually in the red_basket, as confirmed by Carter's private statement to Ava. Therefore, the answer is option L. red_basket.
