This question requires a lot of steps to solve. Let's break it down:

1. We need to determine where Carter thinks the tangerine is.
2. We need to determine where Ava thinks the tangerine is.
3. We need to determine where Amelia thinks the tangerine is.
4. We need to determine where Carter thinks Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is.

Step 1: Where does Carter think the tangerine is?
We know from the story that Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red_basket. Therefore, Carter thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.

Step 2: Where does Ava think the tangerine is?
We don't have any direct information about where Ava thinks the tangerine is. However, we do know that Ava dislikes the corn, which is not relevant to the question but is important to note. We also know that Ava made no movements in the cellar and exited before Sophia moved the tangerine to the green_bottle. Therefore, Ava could not have seen the tangerine in the green_bottle. We also know that Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green_bottle, but we cannot assume that Ava believes this claim. Therefore, we cannot determine where Ava thinks the tangerine is.

Step 3: Where does Amelia think the tangerine is?
We don't have any direct information about where Amelia thinks the tangerine is. We do know that Amelia made no movements in the cellar and exited before Abigail moved the tangerine to the red_crate. Therefore, Amelia could not have seen the tangerine in the red_crate. We also know that Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green_bottle, but we cannot assume that Amelia believes this claim. Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks the tangerine is.

Step 4: Where does Carter think Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is?
Since we cannot determine where Ava and Amelia think the tangerine is, we cannot determine where Carter thinks they think the tangerine is. Therefore, we cannot answer the question.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
