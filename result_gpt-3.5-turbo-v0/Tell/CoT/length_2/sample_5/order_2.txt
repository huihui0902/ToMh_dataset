To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the watermelon and Benjamin's preferences. According to the story, Benjamin moved the watermelon from the blue_bottle to the green_drawer and likes the blue_bottle. Emma made no movements with the watermelon and exited the workshop after Benjamin. Therefore, Emma would know that Benjamin moved the watermelon to the green_drawer and likes the blue_bottle. So, Emma would think that Benjamin thinks the watermelon is in the G. blue_bottle. 

The answer is G. blue_bottle.
