This question requires a lot of logical reasoning and deduction. We need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions with each other to determine where Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is. 

First, we know that Ava did not move the persimmon and left the bathroom before anyone else. Therefore, she has no idea where the persimmon is. 

Next, Charlotte moved the persimmon to the red_crate before leaving the bathroom. So, she knows that the persimmon is not in the blue_crate anymore. 

Evelyn then moved the persimmon to the blue_cupboard before leaving the bathroom. She knows that the persimmon is not in the red_crate anymore. 

Amelia then moved the persimmon to the green_pantry before leaving the bathroom. She knows that the persimmon is not in the blue_cupboard anymore. 

Finally, Benjamin did not move the persimmon and left the bathroom after everyone else. He knows that the persimmon is not in the green_pantry anymore. 

In the office, Ava moved the onion to the green_box before leaving. Benjamin and Evelyn did not move the onion and left after Ava. Benjamin privately told Evelyn that the onion is in the red_container, but Evelyn privately told Amelia that the onion is in the green_box. 

Based on this information, we can deduce that Charlotte thinks that Evelyn thinks that Ava thinks the persimmon is in the green_box. 

Therefore, the answer is A. green_box.
