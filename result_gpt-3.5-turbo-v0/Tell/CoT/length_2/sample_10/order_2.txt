To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and their private and public interactions. We know that Ava did not move the persimmon, but Charlotte, Evelyn, and Amelia did. Benjamin did not move anything. Ava, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the office together, but only Benjamin stayed there for a minute. Then, Benjamin and Evelyn exited the office together. Later, Benjamin privately told Evelyn that the onion is in the red_container, and Evelyn privately told Amelia that the onion is in the green_box.

Based on these movements and interactions, we can infer that Evelyn trusts Benjamin more than Ava because Benjamin exited the office after her. Therefore, she may believe Benjamin's claim about the onion's location more than Ava's claim about the persimmon's location. We also know that Charlotte moved the persimmon to the red_crate, and Evelyn moved it to the blue_cupboard. Since Evelyn was the last one to move the persimmon and she exited the bathroom before Amelia, she may think that Ava thinks the persimmon is in the blue_cupboard, which is where she left it.

Therefore, the answer is M. blue_cupboard.
