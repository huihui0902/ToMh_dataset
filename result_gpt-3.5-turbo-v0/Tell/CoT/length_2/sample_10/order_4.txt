This question requires a lot of logical reasoning and deduction. We need to trace the path of the persimmon and the agents' movements to determine where Benjamin thinks Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is. 

First, we know that the persimmon starts in the blue_crate and is moved by Charlotte to the red_crate, then by Evelyn to the blue_cupboard, and finally by Amelia to the green_pantry. Ava does not move the persimmon. 

Next, we know that Ava moves the onion from the blue_bathtub to the green_box, and tells no one where she put it. Benjamin privately tells Evelyn that the onion is in the red_container, but we don't know if he is telling the truth or lying. Evelyn privately tells Amelia that the onion is in the green_box. 

Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exit a room later than themselves, we can assume that Benjamin trusts Evelyn more than Charlotte or Ava. Therefore, he is more likely to believe Evelyn's claim about the onion's location. 

However, we are not asked about the onion's location. We are asked about the persimmon's location. We need to determine where Benjamin thinks Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is. 

We know that Charlotte moved the persimmon from the blue_crate to the red_crate, but we don't know if she told anyone where she put it. Evelyn moved the persimmon from the red_crate to the blue_cupboard, but we don't know if she told anyone where she put it. Amelia moved the persimmon from the blue_cupboard to the green_pantry, but we don't know if she told anyone where she put it. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Benjamin thinks Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is. The answer is not given in the story and cannot be deduced based on the information provided.
