To answer this question, we need to track Ava's movements and the movements of the persimmon. According to the story, Ava did not move the persimmon, but Charlotte, Evelyn, and Amelia did. Benjamin also did not move the persimmon. After all the agents exited the bathroom, they entered the waiting room and then the office. In the office, Ava moved the onion to the green_box, and Benjamin and Evelyn were also present. Benjamin privately told Evelyn that the onion is in the red_container, and Evelyn privately told Amelia that the onion is in the green_box.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Ava may not be telling the truth about where she thinks the persimmon is. However, we can infer that she may trust Benjamin's claim about the onion being in the red_container since he exited the office after her. Therefore, Ava may think that the persimmon is in the red_crate, which is the option (N) in the multiple-choice question. 

So the answer is (N) red_crate.
