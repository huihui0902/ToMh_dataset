This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Here are the steps to solve the question:

1. Identify the agents involved in the question: Logan, Isla, and Jacob.
2. Determine the last place where Logan, Isla, and Jacob were together: the waiting_room.
3. Determine the last action related to the watermelon: Isla moved the watermelon to the red_container.
4. Determine the last action related to Jacob and the eggplant: Jacob privately told Isla that the eggplant is in the red_pantry.
5. Apply the assumptions to determine what Logan thinks Isla thinks Jacob thinks about the watermelon:
- Logan was in the waiting_room with Isla and Jacob, so he can infer Jacob's thought from Isla's private conversation.
- Logan publicly claimed that the eggplant is in the red_box, which means he is lying.
- Isla and Jacob did not have any public or private interactions related to the watermelon, so Logan cannot infer their thoughts directly.
- Isla exited the front_yard after Jacob, so Logan tends to trust her more than Jacob.
- Therefore, Logan thinks Isla thinks Jacob thinks the watermelon is in the red_container, which is the last known location of the watermelon.

The answer is A. red_container.
