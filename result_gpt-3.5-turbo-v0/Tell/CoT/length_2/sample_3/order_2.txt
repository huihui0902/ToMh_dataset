To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Hannah and Emma and their interactions with each other. 

According to the story, Hannah moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest and then exited the hallway. Emma moved the peas to the red_pantry and then exited the hallway. 

Later, Logan publicly claimed that the peas is in the green_bottle, but Emma privately told Logan that the peas is in the red_bottle. 

Since Hannah and Emma did not have any interactions with each other, we cannot directly infer where Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is. However, we can use the assumption that an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. 

Since Hannah exited the hallway before Emma, she would not trust Emma's claim about the location of the peas. Therefore, Hannah would likely think that Emma thinks the peas is in a different location than what she privately told Logan. 

Based on the story, the only other location that the peas was in at some point is the blue_treasure_chest, which is where Hannah moved the peas to. Therefore, Hannah would likely think that Emma thinks the peas is in the blue_treasure_chest. 

The answer is E. blue_treasure_chest.
