To answer this question, we need to follow Emma's movements and interactions with other agents. Emma first enters the hallway with Logan, Isabella, Hannah, and Chloe. She then stays in the hallway for one minute before exiting. Later, she enters the hallway again with Isabella and Logan. Isabella moves the peas to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting, and Logan moves the peas to the blue_bathtub before exiting. Emma then moves the peas to the red_pantry before exiting. 

We know from the story that Logan publicly claimed that the peas is in the green_bottle, but Emma privately told Logan that the peas is in the red_bottle. However, we cannot assume that Emma actually thinks the peas is in the red_bottle just because she told Logan that. We need to consider her movements and interactions with other agents. 

Based on the story, Emma never moved the peas to the red_bottle. The peas was in the red_bottle when Logan first entered the hallway, and it was still in the red_bottle when Isabella, Logan, and Emma entered the waiting_room together. Emma only moved the peas once, to the red_pantry, after Isabella had already moved it to the blue_treasure_chest and Logan had moved it to the blue_bathtub. 

Therefore, the answer is B. red_pantry. Emma moved the peas to the red_pantry before exiting the hallway.
