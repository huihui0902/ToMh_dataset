To solve this question, we need to follow the movements of each agent and their interactions. According to the story, the peas was initially in the red_bottle (step 2), then Isabella moved it to the green_bottle (step 7), then Hannah moved it to the blue_treasure_chest (step 9), and finally Chloe moved it back to the red_bottle (step 12). However, in step 17, when Isabella, Logan, and Emma entered the hallway again, the peas was back in the red_bottle. Logan publicly claimed that the peas is in the green_bottle (step 25), but Emma privately told Logan that the peas is in the red_bottle (step 26). Since Emma was in the hallway after Logan and had a private interaction with him, we can assume that Logan trusts her more than Isabella, who moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest. Therefore, the peas is actually in the red_bottle, which is option A.
