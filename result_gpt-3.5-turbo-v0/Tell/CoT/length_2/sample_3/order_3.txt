This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Chloe think Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is?

2. Chloe exited the hallway before Hannah, so she trusts Hannah more than Emma.

3. Hannah moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest, so Chloe knows that Hannah thinks the peas is in the blue_treasure_chest.

4. Emma privately told Logan that the peas is in the red_bottle, so Chloe knows that Emma thinks the peas is in the red_bottle.

5. Chloe did not witness Isabella's movements, so she cannot infer where Isabella thinks the peas is.

6. Isabella moved the peas to the green_bottle, but Chloe does not know this information.

7. Therefore, Chloe thinks that Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is in the blue_treasure_chest.

The answer is E. blue_treasure_chest.
