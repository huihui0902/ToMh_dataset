This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Liam think the grapes are?
- Liam made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute, so he did not see the grapes being moved.
- The grapes were initially in the blue_pantry, but were moved to the blue_suitcase by Benjamin.
- Therefore, Liam likely still thinks the grapes are in the blue_pantry.

2. Where does Elizabeth think Liam thinks the grapes are?
- Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute, so she did not see the grapes being moved either.
- We know that Liam likely thinks the grapes are in the blue_pantry.
- However, we don't have any information about what Elizabeth thinks about the location of the grapes, so we cannot determine where she thinks Liam thinks they are.

3. Where does Alexander think Elizabeth thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the grapes are?
- Alexander moved the grapes from the blue_suitcase to the red_crate after Benjamin had already left the workshop.
- We know that Liam likely thinks the grapes are in the blue_pantry, but we don't know what Elizabeth thinks.
- Benjamin lost his phone in the garage after moving the watermelon to the red_pantry, so he did not hear any public claims about the location of the grapes.
- However, Owen privately told Benjamin that the watermelon is in the red_pantry, so Benjamin knows that Owen is trustworthy.
- Alexander made no movements in the garage and stayed there for 1 minute, so he did not see the watermelon being moved.
- Therefore, Alexander likely trusts Benjamin's claim that the watermelon is in the green_pantry, and he likely thinks that Owen is telling the truth about the location of the watermelon.
- Since Owen privately told Benjamin that the watermelon is in the red_pantry, Alexander likely thinks that Benjamin knows the true location of the watermelon.
- We don't have any information about what Liam thinks about the location of the grapes, so we cannot determine where Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the grapes are.

Based on the information given, we cannot determine the answer to the question.
