To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Benjamin and the grapes, as well as Liam's movements and interactions with Benjamin. 

According to the story, Benjamin initially moved the grapes from the blue_pantry to the blue_suitcase, and later moved the watermelon to the red_pantry. Liam made no movements while in the workshop, but later expressed a preference for the red_bucket. 

There is no direct interaction between Liam and Benjamin regarding the location of the grapes. However, we do know that Owen moved the grapes to the blue_pantry after Benjamin moved them to the blue_suitcase, and Alexander later moved them to the red_crate. 

Based on these movements, it is possible that Liam may think Benjamin still believes the grapes are in the blue_suitcase, since Liam did not witness Owen or Alexander moving the grapes. However, we cannot be certain of this, as Liam may have overheard or been told about the movements of the grapes by another agent. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is E. blue_suitcase, but with some uncertainty.
