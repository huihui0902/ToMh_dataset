To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Aiden and Emily and their interactions with each other. Aiden made no movements in the hall and stayed in the bathroom for 1 minute before exiting. Emily made no movements in the hall and stayed in the hall for 1 minute before exiting. Aiden privately told Emily that the carrot is in the green_basket. 

We know that Emily likes the red_crate and that the carrot is not in the blue_crate. We also know that Hannah moved the carrot to the green_drawer and then Owen moved it to the green_basket. However, we are looking for where Emily thinks Aiden thinks the asparagus is, not the carrot. 

Unfortunately, there is no information in the story about where the asparagus is currently located. We only know that it was initially in the green_cupboard and then Hannah moved it to the green_treasure_chest. 

Therefore, we cannot answer this question with the given information. The correct answer is: Insufficient information.
