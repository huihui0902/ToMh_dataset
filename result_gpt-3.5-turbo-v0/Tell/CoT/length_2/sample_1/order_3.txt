First, we need to determine where Amelia thinks the persimmon is. According to assumption (2), Aiden can only infer Amelia's thought if they have been in the same place or had a private interaction. From the story, we know that Amelia moved the persimmon to the green_drawer (step 18) and privately told Ella that the persimmon is in the red_box (step 27). Therefore, we can conclude that Amelia thinks the persimmon is in the red_box.

Next, we need to determine where Owen thinks the persimmon is. We don't have any direct information about Owen's thoughts, but we can use assumption (4) to make an inference. Since Owen exited the closet before Aiden, Aiden is more likely to trust Owen's judgment. From step 5, we know that Owen made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute. Therefore, we can assume that Owen did not see the persimmon being moved and still thinks it is in the blue_pantry (step 2).

Finally, we can answer the question. Aiden thinks that Amelia thinks Owen thinks the persimmon is in the blue_pantry (answer choice G), since Owen has not seen the persimmon being moved and Aiden knows that Amelia thinks it is in the red_box.
