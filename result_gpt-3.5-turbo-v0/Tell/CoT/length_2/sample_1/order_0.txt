To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the persimmon and the agents. According to the story, the persimmon was initially in the blue_pantry (statement 2). Aiden moved it to the green_treasure_chest (statement 7), and then Amelia moved it to the blue_pantry (statement 11) before finally moving it to the green_drawer (statement 18). 

Ella publicly claimed that the persimmon is in the blue_bottle (statement 26), but we know that the agents tend to lie (assumption 3). Additionally, Amelia privately told Ella that the persimmon is in the red_box (statement 27). 

Based on the movements of the persimmon and the private conversation between Amelia and Ella, we can conclude that the persimmon is actually in the red_box (statement 27) and not in the blue_bottle as claimed by Ella. Therefore, the answer is H. red_box.
