To answer this question, we need to track where the persimmon has been moved throughout the story and who has interacted with it. From the story, we know that the persimmon was initially in the blue_pantry, then moved to the green_treasure_chest by Aiden, then to the blue_pantry by Amelia, and finally to the green_drawer by Amelia. 

We also know that Owen made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute, so he did not interact with the persimmon. Therefore, Amelia would not have any information about where Owen thinks the persimmon is based on her interactions with it. 

The answer is none of the above, as Amelia does not have any information about where Owen thinks the persimmon is.
