To answer this question, we need to look at the movements and interactions of Owen and other agents related to the persimmon. According to the story, Owen made no movements in the closet and stayed there for 1 minute before exiting. Aiden moved the persimmon from the blue_pantry to the green_treasure_chest before exiting the closet. Amelia moved the persimmon from the blue_pantry to the green_drawer before exiting the closet. Ella publicly claimed that the persimmon is in the blue_bottle, but Amelia privately told Ella that the persimmon is in the red_box.

Based on these movements and interactions, we can eliminate some options. Owen did not move the persimmon, so options A, C, E, L, and O can be eliminated. There is no mention of Owen interacting with Ella or Amelia, so options B, D, K, M, and N can also be eliminated.

That leaves us with two options: green_drawer and red_box. Amelia moved the persimmon to the green_drawer, but she also told Ella that the persimmon is in the red_box. Since Owen exited the closet after Aiden and before Amelia, he may be more likely to trust Amelia's private claim over Ella's public claim. Therefore, Owen may really think that the persimmon is in the red_box.

The answer is H. red_box.
