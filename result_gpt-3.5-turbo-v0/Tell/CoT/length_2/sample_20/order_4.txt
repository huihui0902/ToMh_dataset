This question requires a lot of logical reasoning and deduction. We need to trace the movements of the melon and the agents' thoughts about it. 

First, Lily did not move the melon and left the garden before anyone else moved it. Therefore, she has no idea where the melon is. 

Amelia moved the melon to the green_bucket, but we don't know if she told anyone about it. 

Jacob moved the melon to the green_drawer, but again, we don't know if he shared this information with anyone. 

Evelyn moved the melon to the green_bottle, but we don't know if she told anyone about it. 

Finally, Ava moved the melon back to the blue_treasure_chest. We don't know if she knew where the melon was before she moved it, but we do know that she put it back in the blue_treasure_chest. 

Now we need to consider the agents' thoughts about the melon's location. We know that Lily has no idea where the melon is. We don't know if Amelia, Jacob, or Evelyn shared their knowledge about the melon's location with anyone else. 

However, we do know that Jacob publicly claimed that the cherry is in the red_box, even though he moved it to the blue_bottle. This means that we can't trust Jacob's public claims about the location of objects. 

We also know that Amelia privately told Jacob that the cherry is in the red_envelope. This means that Amelia knows where the cherry is, but we don't know if she knows where the melon is. 

Based on all of this information, we can't definitively say where Ava thinks Evelyn thinks Lily thinks Jacob thinks the melon is. However, we do know that the melon was last seen in the blue_treasure_chest, which is option B. Therefore, the answer is B.
