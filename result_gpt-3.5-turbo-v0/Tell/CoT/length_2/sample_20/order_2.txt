The question is asking about Lily's thoughts on Jacob's thoughts about the location of the melon. To answer this question, we need to trace Jacob's movements with the melon and determine where Lily was present with Jacob or had interactions with him. 

Jacob moved the melon to the green_drawer, which means Lily was not present with him at that time. However, Lily did have interactions with Amelia, who moved the melon to the green_bucket. Therefore, Lily knows that the melon was moved from the blue_treasure_chest to the green_bucket. 

Since Lily did not witness Jacob moving the melon to the green_drawer, she cannot be sure if he knows that the melon is now in the green_bucket. However, Lily did witness Ava moving the melon to the blue_treasure_chest, which was the original location of the melon. Therefore, Lily may think that Jacob still believes the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest. 

The answer is B. blue_treasure_chest.
