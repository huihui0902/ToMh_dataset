To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Nathan and the pear. According to the story, Nathan moved the pear to the blue_pantry (step 13) and later moved the cherry to the red_container (step 19). Amelia moved the pear to the green_bucket (step 8) and later moved the cherry to the red_envelope (step 21). Isabella privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_crate (step 27).

We don't have any information about Nathan's thoughts on the location of the pear, but we do know that Amelia moved the pear to a different location than where Nathan left it. Therefore, we can assume that Amelia does not think Nathan knows where the pear is.

Looking at the answer choices, the only location where Nathan was known to have placed the pear is the blue_pantry, which is option L. Therefore, Amelia cannot think that Nathan thinks the pear is in any of the other locations. The answer is L.
