This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Nathan think the pear is? 
We know that Nathan moved the pear to the blue_pantry (step 13), so that is where he thinks it is.

2. Where does Amelia think the pear is? 
Amelia moved the pear to the green_bucket (step 8), but we don't know if she saw Nathan move it to the blue_pantry. We also don't know if she had any private or public interactions with Nathan or Isabella that would give her more information. Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks the pear is.

3. Where does Isabella think Amelia thinks the pear is? 
Isabella privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_crate (step 27), but we don't know if she mentioned anything about the pear. However, we do know that Isabella saw a mouse (step 7) and lost his gloves (step 11) while in the sunroom with Amelia and Aiden, who both moved the pear. Isabella also stayed in the study for 1 minute (step 23) and exited after Nathan and Amelia, who both moved the cherry. Based on the assumption that Isabella tends to trust agents who exited the room later than himself, he may trust Nathan's location of the pear in the blue_pantry. However, we cannot determine where Isabella thinks Amelia thinks the pear is.

Therefore, the answer is indeterminate and cannot be determined based on the given information.
