To answer this question, we need to follow Nathan's movements and any interactions he had with other agents. Nathan moved the cherry to the red_container in the study and then Amelia moved it to the red_envelope. There is no information about Nathan's interactions with Isabella, Owen, Aiden, or Amelia regarding the pear. However, Isabella privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_crate, which means that Isabella is lying about the cherry's location. Therefore, we cannot trust Isabella's claim about the pear's location either. 

Based on Nathan's movements and interactions, the only information we have is that he moved the cherry to the red_container in the study. We do not know where he thinks the pear is. Therefore, the answer is not given in the story and cannot be determined.
