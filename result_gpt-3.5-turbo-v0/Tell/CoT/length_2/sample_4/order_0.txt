To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the cherry and the agents. According to the story, the cherry was initially in the blue_suitcase (statement 2). Isla moved the cherry to the red_bottle (statement 7), Ava moved it to the green_basket (statement 9), and finally, Nathan moved it back to the blue_suitcase (statement 11). Therefore, the cherry is in the blue_suitcase (option G). 

Note that we cannot trust any statements made by the agents, as they tend to lie (assumption 3). Also, the movements of Emma and William are not relevant to the location of the cherry.
