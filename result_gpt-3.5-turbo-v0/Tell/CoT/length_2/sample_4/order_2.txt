To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Nathan and the cherry. We know that the cherry was initially in the blue_suitcase, then Isla moved it to the red_bottle, Ava moved it to the green_basket, and finally Nathan moved it to the blue_suitcase again. 

We also know that William saw a cat before Nathan exited the sunroom, so he did not witness Nathan moving the cherry back to the blue_suitcase. 

Therefore, William would not know that the cherry is back in the blue_suitcase and would likely think that it is still in the last place he saw it, which was the red_bottle. 

So, the answer is I. red_bottle.
