This question requires a lot of attention to detail and inference based on the assumptions given. We need to track where the cherry and the agents are at each step and who knows what information. 

First, we know that Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase and William saw a cat after that. So, William cannot know where the cherry is. 

Next, we know that Isla moved the cherry to the red_bottle and Ava moved it to the green_basket before Nathan exited the sunroom. So, Nathan cannot know where the cherry is either. 

Therefore, Ava cannot think that William thinks Nathan knows where the cherry is. 

We can eliminate options A, B, C, and G. 

Now, we need to focus on where Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. We know that Isla privately told William that the sweet_potato is in the green_bathtub. However, we cannot assume that William trusts Isla's information. 

We need to look at where the cherry was last seen before William exited the sunroom. The cherry was in the blue_suitcase, which is the same place where Nathan moved it. Therefore, Ava may think that William thinks the cherry is still in the blue_suitcase. 

The answer is option G, blue_suitcase.
