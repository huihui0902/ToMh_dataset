To answer this question, we need to trace Nathan's movements and any interactions he had with other agents. According to the story, Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase (step 11) and then exited the sunroom (step 13). There is no mention of Nathan having any private or public interactions with any other agents regarding the cherry's location. Therefore, we can assume that Nathan's actual thought is that the cherry is in the blue_suitcase. The answer is G. blue_suitcase.
