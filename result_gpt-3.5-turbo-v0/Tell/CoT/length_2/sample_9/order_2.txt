To answer this question, we need to determine where Jack moved the apple and who knows about it. According to the story, Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle and then exited the den. After that, no one else entered the den before the agents entered the waiting_room. Therefore, only Jack knows that the apple is in the green_bottle. However, Evelyn did not have any interactions with Jack, so she cannot know where Jack thinks the apple is. Therefore, the answer is not given in the story and cannot be determined.
