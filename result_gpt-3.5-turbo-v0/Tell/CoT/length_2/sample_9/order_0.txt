To solve this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions. According to the story, Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle, but we don't know if he told anyone about it. However, we do know that no one else made any movements in the den or waiting room, so they couldn't have moved the apple. Therefore, the apple must still be in the green_bottle. The answer is D. green_bottle.
