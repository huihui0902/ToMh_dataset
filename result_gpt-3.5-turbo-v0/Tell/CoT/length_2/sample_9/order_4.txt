This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Amelia think Ella thinks Evelyn thinks Jack thinks the apple is?

2. We know that Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle, but we need to determine where each agent thinks the apple is.

3. We don't have any information about what Amelia thinks about the apple's location, so we need to work backwards from what she knows about Ella and Evelyn.

4. We know that Ella publicly claimed that the onion is in the green_treasure_chest, but we need to determine if she made any public claims about the apple's location.

5. We also know that Evelyn privately told Ella that the onion is in the red_pantry, but we don't have any information about what she told Ella about the apple's location.

6. We know that Ella likes the green_bucket, but we don't have any information about how this relates to the apple's location.

7. Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exit a room later than themselves, we can assume that each agent trusts the information provided by the agents who exited the den and sunroom after them.

8. Therefore, we can assume that Amelia trusts Jack's claim that the apple is in the green_bottle.

9. We also know that each agent tends to lie, so we can't assume that any public or private claims about the apple's location are true.

10. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Amelia thinks that Ella thinks that Evelyn thinks that Jack thinks the apple is in the green_bottle.

11. Therefore, the answer is D. green_bottle.
