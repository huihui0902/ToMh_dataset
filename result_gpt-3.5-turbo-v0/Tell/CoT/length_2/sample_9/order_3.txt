This question requires a bit of deduction and inference. We need to figure out where each agent thinks the apple is and who they trust. From the story, we know that Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle and then left the den. Therefore, Jack thinks the apple is in the green_bottle. 

Next, we need to figure out who knows where the apple is. We know that Evelyn stayed in the den and then the sunroom without making any movements, so she doesn't know where the apple is. Amelia stayed in the den and then the sunroom without making any movements, so she also doesn't know where the apple is. Ella stayed in the den for a minute without making any movements, so she doesn't know where the apple is either. 

Now, we need to figure out who trusts whom. According to the assumptions, agents tend to trust agents who exited the room later than themselves. We know that Jack exited the den before everyone else, so no one trusts him. We also know that Hannah exited the den last, so everyone trusts her. 

Finally, we need to figure out where each agent thinks the other agents think the apple is. Since no one knows where the apple is except for Jack, everyone else will have to make a guess. We don't have any information about where Hannah thinks the apple is, so we can't use her to help us. 

Evelyn doesn't know where the apple is, so she can't have an opinion on where Jack thinks it is. Amelia and Ella also don't know where the apple is, so they can't have an opinion on where Jack thinks it is either. However, we do know that Ella moved the onion to the red_pantry and publicly claimed that it was in the green_treasure_chest. We also know that Evelyn privately told Ella that the onion is in the red_pantry. Therefore, we can infer that Ella trusts Evelyn more than she trusts herself or Amelia. 

Since Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle, and we know that Ella trusts Evelyn more than herself or Amelia, we can assume that Ella thinks that Evelyn thinks that Jack thinks the apple is in the green_bottle. Therefore, the answer is D. green_bottle.
