To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the cherry and the agents who interacted with it. 

First, Chloe moved the cherry from the red_drawer to the green_pantry. Then, Owen moved the cherry from the green_pantry to the green_bucket. 

Therefore, the cherry is in the green_bucket, which is option K. 

The correct answer is K.
