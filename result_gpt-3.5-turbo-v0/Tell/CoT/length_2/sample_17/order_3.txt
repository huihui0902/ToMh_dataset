This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Abigail think Ella thinks Owen thinks the cherry is?

2. To answer this question, we need to start with Owen's movements. According to the story, Owen moved the cherry to the green_bucket.

3. Next, we need to consider Ella's movements. Ella moved the apple to the green_bathtub, but there is no mention of her moving the cherry.

4. Emma made no movements, so we can ignore her for now.

5. Chloe moved the apple to the green_crate, but there is no mention of her moving the cherry.

6. Abigail made no movements, so we need to consider her thoughts based on what she witnessed and what she was told.

7. According to the story, Chloe privately told Owen that the apple is in the green_crate. This means that Abigail may have overheard this conversation and knows that Chloe thinks the apple is in the green_crate.

8. However, we need to focus on the cherry, not the apple. There is no mention of anyone telling Owen where the cherry is, so we can assume that he doesn't know.

9. Ella publicly claimed that the apple is in the blue_container, but this doesn't give us any information about the cherry.

10. Based on the information we have, Abigail has no reason to think that Ella thinks Owen knows where the cherry is.

11. Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
