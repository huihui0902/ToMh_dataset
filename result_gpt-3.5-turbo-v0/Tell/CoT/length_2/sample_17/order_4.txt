This is a complex question that requires breaking down the thought process of each character. 

First, we need to determine where the cherry is currently located. We know that Chloe moved it to the green_pantry and Owen moved it to the green_bucket. Therefore, the cherry is currently in the green_bucket.

Next, we need to determine who knows where the cherry is. Chloe and Owen both know where it is, but they have already exited the staircase and are not in communication with Abigail, Ella, or Emma.

We know that Emma made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute, so she did not see where the cherry was moved. Ella and Abigail also made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute, so they did not see where the cherry was moved either.

However, we do know that Chloe privately told Owen that the apple is in the green_crate. This means that Owen knows where the apple is, but he does not know where the cherry is.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Abigail can only infer where the cherry is based on the actions and statements of the other characters. She knows that Chloe moved the cherry to the green_pantry, but she does not know that Owen moved it to the green_bucket. Therefore, she may think that the cherry is still in the green_pantry.

Ella made a public claim that the apple is in the blue_container, but this does not give any information about where the cherry is.

Emma made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute, so she did not see where the cherry was moved. However, she knows that Chloe privately told Owen that the apple is in the green_crate. This means that she may think that Owen knows where the cherry is, but she does not know where Abigail or Ella think the cherry is.

Therefore, the answer to the question is that we cannot determine where Emma thinks Abigail thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks the cherry is, as there is not enough information given to make that inference.
