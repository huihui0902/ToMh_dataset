To answer this question, we need to track the movements and actions of Hannah and Liam regarding the sweet_potato. Liam did not move or interact with the sweet_potato during his time in the cellar, and Hannah also did not move or interact with it during her time in the cellar. Therefore, we can assume that Hannah has no direct knowledge of where Liam thinks the sweet_potato is.

However, we do know that Mila moved the sweet_potato from the red_drawer to the red_crate while Hannah was not in the cellar. When Liam, Mila, and Evelyn re-entered the cellar, the sweet_potato was in the red_crate. Liam again did not move or interact with the sweet_potato during his time in the cellar.

Therefore, we can infer that Liam thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_crate, since that is where it was when he was last in the cellar. However, we do not know if Hannah is aware of this information or if she has any other thoughts or beliefs about the sweet_potato's location.

Based on the given options, we cannot definitively determine where Hannah thinks Liam thinks the sweet_potato is.
