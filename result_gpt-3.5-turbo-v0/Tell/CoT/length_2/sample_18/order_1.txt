To answer this question, we need to track Liam's movements and any interactions he had with other agents regarding the sweet_potato. Liam entered the cellar with Hannah, Emma, Mila, and Evelyn. He made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. Later, Liam, Mila, and Evelyn entered the cellar again, and Liam made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. There is no mention of Liam having any private or public interactions regarding the sweet_potato.

Based on these movements and interactions, we can eliminate all options except for D. red_basket and M. red_container. The sweet_potato was moved from the red_drawer to the red_crate by Mila, and later from the red_crate to the red_container by Mila. Liam was present in the cellar both times the sweet_potato was in the red container. Since Liam made no movements and had no interactions regarding the sweet_potato, we cannot determine his actual thought. However, we know that Liam tends to lie, so we cannot trust any public claims he may make. Therefore, the answer is either D. red_basket or M. red_container, but we cannot determine which one Liam actually thinks the sweet_potato is in.
