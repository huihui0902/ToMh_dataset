This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. To start, we need to identify the agents involved in the question: Ava, Noah, and Charlotte. We also need to consider their movements and interactions in the story.

Step 1: Identify Ava's movements and interactions
- Ava entered the garden with Chloe, Charlotte, Nathan, and Noah (line 2)
- Ava made no movements and stayed in the garden for 1 minute (line 10)
- Ava exited the garden (line 11)
- Ava likes the red_bucket (line 28)
- Ava did not have any public or private interactions related to the potato

Step 2: Identify Noah's movements and interactions
- Noah entered the garden with Chloe, Charlotte, Nathan, and Ava (line 2)
- Noah moved the potato to the blue_cupboard (line 15)
- Noah moved the potato to the blue_crate (line 25)
- Noah exited the garden (line 16)
- Nathan privately told Noah that the potato is in the blue_crate (line 31)
- Noah dislikes the cherry (line 24)
- Noah did not have any public or private interactions related to Charlotte's thoughts about the potato

Step 3: Identify Charlotte's movements and interactions
- Charlotte likes the blue_treasure_chest (line 1)
- Charlotte entered the garden with Chloe, Ava, Nathan, and Noah (line 2)
- Charlotte likes the green_bathtub (line 5)
- Charlotte made no movements and stayed in the garden for 1 minute (line 7)
- Charlotte exited the garden (line 8)
- Charlotte publicly claimed that potato is in the blue_cupboard (line 29)
- Charlotte likes the green_bucket (line 30)
- Charlotte did not have any private interactions related to the potato

Step 4: Analyze the question
The question asks where Ava thinks Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is. We know that Ava did not have any public or private interactions related to the potato, so she cannot know the actual location of the potato. However, we can use the assumptions to infer what Ava might think based on her observations and interactions with the other agents.

- Ava was in the garden with Noah and Charlotte when they moved the potato (lines 2 and 15)
- Ava saw Charlotte make a public claim about the potato's location (line 29)
- Ava likes the red_bucket (line 28)

Based on these observations, Ava might think that Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is in the blue_cupboard (the location that Charlotte publicly claimed). This is because Ava saw Charlotte make the claim and Noah was present when she made it. However, we cannot be certain of Ava's thoughts since she did not have any private interactions related to the potato.

Therefore, the answer is A. blue_cupboard.
