To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the potato and the statements made by the characters. According to the story, the potato was initially in the blue cupboard (step 3), then Chloe moved it to the green bottle (step 4), Nathan moved it to the blue bathtub (step 13), and finally, Noah moved it to the blue crate (step 25). 

Charlotte publicly claimed that the potato is in the blue cupboard (step 29), but we know that the characters tend to lie. Nathan privately told Noah that the potato is in the blue crate (step 31), but we don't know if Noah can be trusted. 

Based on the movements of the potato, the correct answer is D. blue_crate.
