To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Amelia and Chloe and their interactions with the carrot. According to the story, Chloe moved the carrot to the green_box, which means she knows the carrot's location. Amelia, on the other hand, did not move the carrot and lost his phone while in the garage. 

There is no direct interaction between Amelia and Chloe regarding the carrot's location. However, we know that Sophia privately told Jack that the carrot is in the green_box. Since Chloe was in the same place as Sophia, she could have overheard the conversation and know the carrot's location. 

Therefore, Amelia might think that Chloe thinks the carrot is in the green_box. The answer is N. green_box.
