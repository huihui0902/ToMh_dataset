To answer this question, we need to trace the path of the melon and who knows where it is. According to the story, Ella moved the melon to the blue bottle, then Owen moved it to the green envelope, and finally, Aiden moved it to the blue suitcase. However, Owen privately told Aiden that the melon is in the blue suitcase. Therefore, Owen knows that the melon is in the blue suitcase, but he dislikes pears, not melons. 

Now, we need to find out where Aiden thinks the melon is. Since Owen told Aiden that the melon is in the blue suitcase, Aiden knows that the melon is in the blue suitcase. 

Next, we need to find out where Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. Since Owen knows that the melon is in the blue suitcase, he thinks that Aiden also knows that the melon is in the blue suitcase. 

Finally, we need to find out where Evelyn thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. Since Aiden privately told Evelyn that the banana is in the green cupboard, we can assume that Evelyn trusts Aiden's word. Therefore, she thinks that Aiden knows that the melon is in the blue suitcase. Since Owen dislikes pears, not melons, we can assume that he did not tell anyone else where the melon is. Therefore, Evelyn thinks that Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue suitcase. 

Therefore, the answer is D. blue suitcase.
