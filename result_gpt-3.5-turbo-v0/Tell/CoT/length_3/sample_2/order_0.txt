To determine where the melon really is, we need to track its movements based on the given story and assumptions. Here are the steps:

1. Ella moved the melon to the blue_bottle.
2. Owen moved the melon to the green_envelope.
3. Isla privately told Ella that the melon is in the green_treasure_chest.
4. Owen privately told Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase.
5. Aiden moved the melon to the blue_suitcase.

Based on these steps, we can conclude that the melon is in the blue_suitcase. Therefore, the answer is D. blue_suitcase.
