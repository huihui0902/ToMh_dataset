Step 1: Identify the agents involved in the question. The question asks about Owen's thoughts about Aiden's thoughts, so we need to focus on Owen and Aiden.

Step 2: Determine the interactions between Owen and Aiden. According to the story, Owen privately told Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase (step 17).

Step 3: Determine the movements of Owen and Aiden. After their private interaction, Owen and Aiden both entered the back_yard (step 18), and then Owen moved the lemon to the blue_treasure_chest (step 20) before exiting the back_yard (step 21). Aiden then moved the lemon to the blue_suitcase (step 23) before exiting the back_yard (step 24).

Step 4: Determine the exit order of Owen and Aiden. Aiden exited the back_yard after Owen (step 24), so Owen would tend to trust Aiden's thoughts.

Step 5: Determine where Aiden thinks the melon is. According to Aiden's private communication with Evelyn (step 41), he told her that the banana is in the green_cupboard.

Step 6: Determine where Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. Since Owen would tend to trust Aiden's thoughts and Aiden thinks the banana is in the green_cupboard, Owen would think that Aiden thinks the melon is in the green_cupboard.

Answer: N. green_cupboard.
