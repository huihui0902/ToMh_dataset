To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of Ella, Owen, and Aiden regarding the melon. According to the story, Ella initially moved the melon to the blue_bottle and then exited the back_yard. Owen later moved the melon to the green_envelope and then exited the back_yard. Finally, Aiden moved the melon to the blue_suitcase before exiting the back_yard. 

Now, we need to determine where Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is. Since Ella moved the melon to the blue_bottle and then left the back_yard, she may not know where Owen moved the melon. However, we know that Owen told Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase. Therefore, Ella may think that Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue_suitcase. 

So, the answer is D. blue_suitcase.
