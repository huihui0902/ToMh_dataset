To determine where the turnip really is, we need to track its movements throughout the story. According to the story, the turnip starts in the green_crate (2), is moved to the blue_pantry by Liam (5), then to the red_bottle by William (7), and finally ends up in the green_basket after Sophia and Benjamin move it there (20-23). Therefore, the correct answer is A. green_basket.
