To answer this question, we need to track the movements and private interactions of Benjamin and William regarding the turnip. According to the story, Benjamin and William both entered the porch and the waiting room together. William privately told Sophia that the turnip is in the red_bottle, but there is no mention of William telling Benjamin anything about the turnip. However, we know that Benjamin moved the turnip to the green_crate after Sophia moved it to the green_basket. This means that Benjamin knows the turnip was not in the green_basket when he moved it to the green_crate. 

Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, J, and K since Benjamin knows the turnip was not in those locations when he moved it to the green_crate. We can also eliminate options C, E, F, G, H, I, and L since there is no mention of the turnip being in those locations. 

This leaves us with options B and N. Liam privately told Hannah that the turnip is in the green_crate, but we don't know if Benjamin overheard this conversation or not. However, we do know that William saw a monkey after Benjamin exited the porch, which means that Benjamin exited the porch before William. Since Benjamin tends to trust agents who exit a room later than himself, he may assume that William did not see where he moved the turnip to. Therefore, Benjamin may think that William still believes the turnip is in the red_bottle, which is option D. 

So the answer is D. red_bottle.
