To answer this question, we need to trace the movements and interactions of Sophia, Benjamin, and William regarding the turnip. 

1. Sophia, Liam, William, Hannah, and Benjamin entered the porch.
2. The turnip is in the green_crate.
3. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute.
4. Sophia exited the porch.
5. Liam moved the turnip to the blue_pantry.
6. Liam exited the porch.
7. William moved the turnip to the red_bottle.
8. William exited the porch.
9. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute.
10. Hannah exited the porch.
11. William saw a monkey.
12. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute.
13. Benjamin exited the porch.
14. Sophia, Liam, William, Hannah, and Benjamin entered the waiting_room.
15. Sophia saw a mouse.
16. William privately told Sophia that the turnip is in the red_bottle.
17. Liam privately told Hannah that the turnip is in the green_crate.
18. Sophia, Benjamin, and Hannah entered the porch.
19. The turnip is in the red_bottle.
20. Sophia moved the turnip to the green_basket.
21. Sophia exited the porch.
22. Benjamin moved the turnip to the green_crate.
23. Benjamin exited the porch.
24. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the porch for 1 minute.
25. Hannah exited the porch.
26. Sophia, Benjamin, and Hannah entered the waiting_room.

Based on the above movements and interactions, we can infer that Sophia knows the turnip was initially in the green_crate, then moved to the blue_pantry by Liam, and then to the red_bottle by William. However, William privately told Sophia that the turnip is in the red_bottle, which is where it actually is. 

Benjamin was in the porch when William moved the turnip to the red_bottle, but he made no movements and stayed there for a minute before exiting. Therefore, Benjamin does not know where the turnip actually is. 

William did not have any private or public interactions with Benjamin regarding the turnip, so Benjamin cannot infer William's thought about the turnip. 

Therefore, Sophia cannot know where Benjamin thinks William thinks the turnip is. The answer is none of the given options.
