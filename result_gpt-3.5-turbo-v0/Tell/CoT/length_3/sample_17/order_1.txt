To answer this question, we need to track William's movements and interactions with other agents. According to the story, William moved the turnip to the red_bottle and privately told Sophia that the turnip is in the red_bottle. Later, William privately told Hannah that the tomato is in the red_basket. We also know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust what William told Sophia or Hannah. However, we can infer that William thinks the turnip is not in the green_crate (moved by Liam) or the green_basket (moved by Sophia). We also know that the turnip is in the red_bottle according to statement 19. Therefore, the answer is D. red_bottle.
