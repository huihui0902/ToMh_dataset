To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of Abigail and Aiden with respect to the peach. Abigail made no movements when the peach was in the red_bucket, but Aiden moved it to the red_pantry and privately told Sophia that the peach is in the red_envelope. Later, Abigail moved the peach to the red_pantry again. Therefore, Sophia would think that Abigail thinks the peach is in the red_pantry (option N). 

The answer is N. red_pantry.
