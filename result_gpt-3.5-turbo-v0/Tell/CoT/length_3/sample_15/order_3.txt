To solve this question, we need to trace Aiden's thoughts and actions. Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry and privately told Sophia that the peach is in the red_envelope. We also know that Abigail moved the peach to the red_pantry later on. However, we don't have any information about Sophia's thoughts or actions regarding the peach.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Aiden thinks Sophia thinks Abigail thinks the peach is. The answer is not provided in the given story and assumptions.
