To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the peach and the statements made by the agents. According to the story, the peach was initially in the red_bucket (line 2). Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry (line 6) and later privately told Sophia that the peach is in the red_envelope (line 16). However, we know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust this statement. Benjamin privately told Abigail that the peach is in the red_pantry (line 15) and later moved the peach to the red_crate (line 19). Abigail moved the peach to the red_pantry again (line 24) and later moved the plum to the green_cupboard (line 35). Therefore, the peach is in the red_pantry (option N). 

The answer is N. red_pantry.
