To answer this question, we need to track Abigail's movements and any private or public interactions she had regarding the peach. According to the story, Abigail made no movements when the peach was initially in the red_bucket, and she exited the hallway before Aiden moved the peach to the red_pantry. Later, when Benjamin privately told her that the peach is in the red_pantry, she made no movements and exited the hallway. Therefore, based on the given assumptions, we can infer that Abigail did not have any private or public interactions regarding the peach after Benjamin told her its location. So, Abigail really thinks that the peach is in the red_pantry. The answer is N. red_pantry.
