This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. We need to trace the thoughts of Nathan, Elizabeth, Carter, and Isla regarding the location of the watermelon. 

First, Nathan did not make any movements in the kitchen and left before any of the others moved the watermelon. Therefore, he has no direct knowledge of the watermelon's location. 

Elizabeth moved the watermelon to the red_envelope before leaving the kitchen. However, we do not know what she thinks about its current location. 

Carter moved the watermelon to the blue_cupboard before leaving the kitchen. He publicly claimed that the watermelon is in the red_envelope, but Isla privately told him that it is in the blue_container. Therefore, we know that Carter is lying about the watermelon's location. 

Isla made no movements in the kitchen but privately told Carter that the watermelon is in the blue_container. Therefore, we know that Isla knows the true location of the watermelon. 

Based on these facts, we can conclude that Nathan thinks that Elizabeth thinks that Carter thinks that Isla thinks the watermelon is in the red_envelope. This is because Nathan has no direct knowledge of the watermelon's location, and Elizabeth moved it to the red_envelope before leaving the kitchen. Carter publicly claimed that the watermelon is in the red_envelope, so Nathan would assume that he thinks it is there. However, Isla privately told Carter that the watermelon is in the blue_container, so Nathan would assume that Isla thinks it is there. 

Therefore, the answer is J. red_envelope.
