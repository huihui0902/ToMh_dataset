To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the watermelon and the statements made by the agents. 

1. Nathan, Elizabeth, Carter, Jacob, and Isla entered the kitchen.
2. The watermelon is in the blue_bottle.
3. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute.
4. Nathan exited the kitchen.
5. Elizabeth moved the watermelon to the red_envelope.
6. Elizabeth exited the kitchen.
7. Carter moved the watermelon to the blue_cupboard.
8. Carter exited the kitchen.
9. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute.
10. Jacob exited the kitchen.
11. Isla made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute.
12. Carter dislikes the cherry.
13. Isla exited the kitchen.
14. Nathan, Elizabeth, Carter, Jacob, and Isla entered the waiting_room.
15. Carter publicly claimed that watermelon is in the red_envelope.
16. Isla privately told Carter that the watermelon is in the blue_container.
17. Jacob, Carter, and Elizabeth entered the kitchen.
18. The watermelon is in the blue_cupboard.
19. Jacob moved the watermelon to the red_envelope.
20. Jacob exited the kitchen.
21. Carter moved the watermelon to the green_bucket.
22. Carter exited the kitchen.
23. Elizabeth moved the watermelon to the blue_container.
24. Elizabeth exited the kitchen.
25. Jacob, Carter, and Elizabeth entered the waiting_room.

Based on the movements and statements, we can see that the watermelon was initially in the blue_bottle, then moved to the red_envelope by Elizabeth, then to the blue_cupboard by Carter, and finally to the blue_container by Elizabeth. 

Carter publicly claimed that the watermelon is in the red_envelope, but Isla privately told him that it is in the blue_container. Jacob then moved the watermelon from the blue_cupboard to the red_envelope, and Carter moved it to the green_bucket before Elizabeth moved it to the blue_container. 

Therefore, the correct answer is I. blue_container.
