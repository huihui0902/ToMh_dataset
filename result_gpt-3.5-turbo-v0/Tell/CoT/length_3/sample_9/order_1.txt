To answer this question, we need to track Isla's movements and interactions with other agents. According to the story, Isla made no movements in the kitchen and stayed there for one minute before exiting. Later, in the waiting room, Isla privately told Carter that the watermelon is in the blue_container. However, we cannot assume that Isla is telling the truth, as all agents tend to lie. Therefore, we need to look for further evidence. 

When Jacob, Carter, and Elizabeth entered the kitchen, they found the watermelon in the blue_cupboard. Jacob moved the watermelon to the red_envelope before exiting, and Carter moved it to the green_bucket before exiting. Elizabeth then moved the watermelon to the blue_container before exiting. 

Based on this information, we can infer that Isla's private claim to Carter that the watermelon is in the blue_container is likely false, as the watermelon was not in the blue_container when Jacob, Carter, and Elizabeth entered the kitchen. Therefore, Isla's actual thought about the watermelon's location is unknown. 

The answer is not provided in the options given, as Isla's actual thought about the watermelon's location cannot be determined based on the given information.
