This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and the assumptions. We need to track the movements and thoughts of each character and their interactions with each other. 

First, we need to identify the chain of thoughts that Isabella is thinking about. According to the question, Isabella is thinking about what Logan thinks Jackson thinks Jack thinks about the peas. 

We know that Emily publicly claimed that the peas is in the blue_suitcase, but we also know that the characters tend to lie. Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle, so we can assume that she knows the true location of the peas. 

Logan privately told Jackson that the cherry is in the blue_cupboard, but we don't know if Jackson trusts Logan's information. We also don't know if Jack or Emily have any information about the location of the peas. 

Based on the story, we know that Jack likes the blue_crate and moved the peas to the red_crate. However, we also know that Jack tends to lie, so we can't be sure if the peas is actually in the red_crate. 

Isabella moved the potato to the red_basket, but we don't have any information about her thoughts on the location of the peas. 

Therefore, we need to look for clues about what Logan, Jackson, and Jack might think about the location of the peas. Logan made no movements in the hallway and exited before Jackson, so Jackson might trust Logan's information more than Jack's or Emily's. 

Logan moved the potato to the blue_crate in the attic, but we don't know if he has any information about the location of the peas. 

Based on these clues, we can eliminate some of the answer choices. The peas is not in the green_drawer, green_bathtub, green_pantry, red_envelope, red_bucket, or red_pantry, because there is no evidence to suggest that any character has any information about these locations. 

The peas is also not in the blue_suitcase, because we know that Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle. 

The peas is not in the red_crate, because we don't know if Jack was telling the truth when he moved the peas to the red_crate. 

The peas is not in the blue_drawer, because there is no evidence to suggest that any character has any information about this location. 

This leaves us with three possible answer choices: green_bottle, blue_cupboard, and green_envelope. 

Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle, but we don't know if Logan trusts Isabella's information. 

Logan privately told Jackson that the cherry is in the blue_cupboard, but we don't know if Jackson trusts Logan's information. 

Isabella moved the cherry to the green_envelope, but we don't know if she has any information about the location of the peas. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Isabella thinks Logan thinks Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas is. The answer is unknown.
