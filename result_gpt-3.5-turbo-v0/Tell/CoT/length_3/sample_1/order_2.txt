To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Jackson and Jack and their interactions with the peas. According to the story, Jackson made no movements in the hallway, but he dislikes turnips. Jack likes the blue crate and moved the peas from the blue suitcase to the red crate before exiting the hallway. Therefore, Jackson knows that Jack was in the hallway and had access to the peas.

Later, Emily publicly claimed that the peas is in the blue suitcase, but Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green bottle. Since Jackson did not hear Isabella's private conversation with Logan, he still believes that the peas is in the blue suitcase.

After that, Isabella, Emily, Jack, and Logan entered the patio, and Isabella moved the cherry to the green envelope before exiting. Jack made no movements in the patio, so he did not have any interaction with the peas. Therefore, Jackson's belief about where Jack thinks the peas is should not change based on the events in the patio.

Finally, Isabella privately told Emily that the cherry is in the blue cupboard, and Logan privately told Jackson the same thing. Since Jackson trusts Logan more than Isabella (since Logan exited the waiting room after Jackson), he should believe that the cherry is in the blue cupboard. However, this information does not affect his belief about where Jack thinks the peas is.

Therefore, the answer to the question is A. blue_crate, since that is where Jack moved the peas to before exiting the hallway, and Jackson has no reason to believe that Jack's belief about the location of the peas has changed.
