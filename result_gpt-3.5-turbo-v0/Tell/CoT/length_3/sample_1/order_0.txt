To answer this question, we need to follow the movements of the agents and their private and public interactions. According to the story, Emily publicly claimed that the peas is in the blue_suitcase, but Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle. We also know that Logan tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. Therefore, we can infer that the peas is actually in the green_bottle, which is where Isabella told Logan it was. 

The correct answer is M. green_bottle.
