This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and the assumptions. To break it down:

- We are looking for Logan's belief about Jackson's belief about Jack's belief about the location of the peas.
- Logan's belief about Jackson's belief is based on what Jackson publicly claims or privately tells Logan.
- Jackson's belief about Jack's belief is not directly stated in the story, so we need to infer it based on the available information.

To solve the question, we need to trace the information about the peas and the movements of the agents:

- The peas is initially in the blue_suitcase (step 2).
- Jack likes the blue_crate (step 6).
- Jack moves the peas to the red_crate (step 8).
- Emily moves the peas to the green_bottle (step 10).
- Emily publicly claims that peas is in the blue_suitcase (step 16).
- Isabella privately tells Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle (step 17).

Based on this information, we can infer that:

- Jack initially thinks the peas is in the blue_suitcase (since it's the starting location and he hasn't moved it yet).
- Emily thinks the peas is in the green_bottle (since she moved it there and publicly claimed it).
- Isabella knows that the peas is in the green_bottle (since she privately told Logan).
- Jackson's belief about Jack's belief is not directly stated, but we can make some assumptions based on the available information. Since Jack likes the blue_crate and initially thinks the peas is in the blue_suitcase, it's possible that Jackson thinks Jack still believes the peas is in the blue_suitcase or has moved it to the blue_crate (since he likes it). However, we cannot be certain about this.

Now we need to find where Logan thinks Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas is. We know that Logan privately told Jackson that the cherry is in the blue_cupboard (step 41), but this doesn't give us any information about the peas. We also know that Logan exited the attic after Isabella moved the potato to the red_basket (step 21), so he trusts Isabella more than Emily or Jack. Therefore, he might believe that Jackson trusts Isabella more as well. Since Isabella privately told Logan that the peas is in the green_bottle, Logan might think that Jackson believes Jack thinks the peas is in the green_bottle (since Isabella's information is more reliable). Therefore, the answer is M. green_bottle.
