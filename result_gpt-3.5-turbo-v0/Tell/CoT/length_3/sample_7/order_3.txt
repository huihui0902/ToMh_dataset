To answer this question, we need to trace the movements and interactions of Chloe, Sophia, and Amelia regarding the lime. According to the story, Chloe moved the lime to the green_envelope, Sophia moved it back to the green_bottle, and Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle. However, we need to determine where Chloe thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is.

Based on the assumptions given, Chloe can only infer Sophia's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. From the story, we know that Chloe and Sophia were both in the porch and the waiting_room together, but there is no mention of them having any private interactions. Therefore, Chloe can only base her inference on Sophia's public claim.

Sophia publicly claimed that the beans are in the red_box, not the lime. Therefore, Chloe cannot infer where Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
