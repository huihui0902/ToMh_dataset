To determine the location of the lime, we need to track its movements throughout the story. Benjamin initially moved the lime to the green_treasure_chest, but we don't know if it stayed there. Isabella then moved the lime to the blue_crate, but again, we don't know if it stayed there. Chloe then moved the lime to the green_envelope, but we still don't know if it stayed there. Finally, Sophia moved the lime back to the green_bottle. Therefore, the lime is really in the green_bottle. The answer is A.
