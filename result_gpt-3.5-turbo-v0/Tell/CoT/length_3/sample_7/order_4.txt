This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. We need to trace the movements of the lime and the interactions between the characters to determine where Isabella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is.

First, we know that Benjamin moved the lime to the green_treasure_chest, but then Isabella moved it to the blue_crate. Chloe then moved it to the green_envelope, and finally Sophia moved it back to the green_bottle. This means that the lime ended up in the green_bottle, but each character may have a different belief about where it is.

Next, we need to consider the public and private claims made by the characters. Amelia publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle, while Sophia privately told Benjamin the same thing. Isabella, Sophia, and Amelia later entered the laundry, where the beans were in the blue_suitcase. Isabella moved the beans to the blue_bottle, and Sophia later moved them to the blue_drawer. Chloe then moved the beans back to the blue_bottle, and finally Amelia moved them to the green_pantry. Sophia publicly claimed that the beans are in the red_box, while Amelia privately told Chloe that they are in the green_pantry.

Based on this information, we can determine that Isabella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle. This is because Isabella knows that the lime ended up in the green_bottle, and she also knows that Sophia privately told Benjamin that the lime is in the green_bottle. Chloe was not present for this private conversation, so she may not know that Sophia believes the lime is in the green_bottle. However, Isabella knows that Chloe moved the lime to the green_envelope, which is a different location. Therefore, Isabella believes that Chloe has a different belief about where the lime is. Sophia and Amelia both publicly claimed that the lime is in the green_bottle, so Isabella believes that Chloe thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle.

The answer is A. green_bottle.
