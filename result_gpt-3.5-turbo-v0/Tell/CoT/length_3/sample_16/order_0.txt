To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the cherry and the statements made by the agents. According to the story, the cherry was initially in the green_envelope, which Noah liked. However, Owen moved the cherry to the blue_bucket before exiting the front_yard. Aiden then moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard before exiting the front_yard as well. Later, Noah publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green_envelope, but Ella privately told Noah that the cherry is in the blue_bottle. However, we don't know if Ella's statement is true or false. Therefore, we need to look at the movements of the cherry after this point. The cherry is not mentioned again in the story, so we don't know if it was moved again or not. Therefore, the answer to the question is either F. green_envelope or G. blue_bottle, depending on whether Ella's statement is true or false.
