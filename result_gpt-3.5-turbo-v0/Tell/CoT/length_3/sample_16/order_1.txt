To answer this question, we need to trace Aiden's movements and interactions with other agents. Aiden moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard and then exited the front_yard. There is no information about any private or public interactions where Aiden revealed his actual thought about the cherry's location. Therefore, we can only rely on Aiden's last known location of the cherry, which is the blue_cupboard. So, the answer is J. blue_cupboard.
