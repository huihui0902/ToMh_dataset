To answer this question, we need to follow the movements of the onion and the agents. According to the story, the onion was initially in the green_crate (statement 4). Then, Lily moved the onion to the blue_bucket (statement 11), but later Abigail moved it to the red_bucket (statement 29). Finally, Emily moved the onion back to the green_crate (statement 35). 

Mila privately told Jack that the onion is in the green_crate (statement 39), which means that the onion is really in the green_crate. Therefore, the answer is B. green_crate.
