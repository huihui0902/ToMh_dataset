10. Emily exited the master_bedroom.
11. Lily moved the onion to the blue_bucket.
12. Lily exited the master_bedroom.
13. Mila made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute.
14. Mila exited the master_bedroom.
15. Jack, Abigail, Emily, Lily and Mila entered the waiting_room.
16. Lily publicly claimed that onion is in the blue_bucket.
17. Mila privately told Jack that the onion is in the blue_bucket.

25. Emily exited the porch.
26. Mila, Abigail and Emily entered the waiting_room.
27. Abigail, Lily, Mila and Emily entered the master_bedroom.
28. The onion is in the blue_bucket.

37. Abigail, Lily, Mila and Emily entered the waiting_room.
38. Lily privately told Mila that the onion is in the green_crate.
39. Emily privately told Jack that the onion is in the green_crate.

Based on the assumption that Abigail tends to lie, we cannot trust her public claim that the onion is in the red_bucket. We need to look for any private interactions she had with Mila. 

From step 18, we know that Abigail and Mila were together in the porch. However, there is no mention of them discussing the location of the onion. 

From step 26, we know that Abigail, Lily, Mila, and Emily were together in the waiting_room. Again, there is no mention of Abigail and Mila discussing the onion. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is. The answer is unknown.
