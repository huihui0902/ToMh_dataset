To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Avery, Jackson, and Sophia regarding the sweet_potato. According to the story, Sophia initially moved the sweet_potato from the red_box to the green_bottle, then Hannah moved it to the green_box, and finally, Jackson moved it back to the red_box. Sophia exited the front_yard after moving the sweet_potato to the green_bottle, and Avery made no movements regarding the sweet_potato. 

We also know that Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box, and Hannah publicly claimed that the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle. 

Since Avery did not witness any of these movements or interactions, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is. Therefore, the answer is not given in the options provided.
