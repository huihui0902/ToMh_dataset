Step 1: Look for all the movements related to the sweet_potato.
- Sophia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle.
- Hannah moved the sweet_potato to the green_box.
- Jackson moved the sweet_potato to the red_box.
Step 2: Look for any public or private claims related to the sweet_potato.
- Hannah publicly claimed that sweet_potato is in the green_bottle.
- Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box.
Step 3: Determine which claim is true based on the assumptions.
- Hannah tends to lie, so her claim may not be true.
- Jackson may be lying or telling the truth, but he is not a reliable source since he had a private conversation with Sophia.
- Sophia's movements were before Hannah and Jackson's movements, so she exited the front_yard later than both of them. Therefore, she is a more reliable source than Hannah or Jackson.
- Sophia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle, but Jackson claimed it is in the red_box. Therefore, Jackson is lying and the sweet_potato is actually in the green_bottle.
Step 4: Choose the correct answer.
The sweet_potato is in the N. green_bottle.
