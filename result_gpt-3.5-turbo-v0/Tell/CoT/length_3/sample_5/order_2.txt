To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the sweet_potato and the interactions between Jackson and Sophia. 

Step 1: Sophia moved the sweet_potato from the red_box to the green_bottle. 

Step 2: Sophia exited the front_yard. 

Step 3: Hannah moved the sweet_potato from the green_bottle to the green_box. 

Step 4: Jackson moved the sweet_potato from the green_box to the red_box. 

Step 5: Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box. 

Based on these steps, we know that Jackson knows the sweet_potato is in the red_box and he told Sophia this information privately. However, we don't know where Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is. 

To answer the question, we need to look for any information about Jackson's thoughts on Sophia's beliefs about the sweet_potato's location. There is no direct information about this in the story. 

Therefore, the answer is unknown or cannot be determined from the given information.
