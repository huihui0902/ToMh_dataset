To answer this question, we need to track Sophia's movements and any private or public interactions she had regarding the sweet_potato. 

1. Sophia entered the front_yard with the sweet_potato in the red_box.
2. Sophia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle.
3. Sophia exited the front_yard.
16. Hannah publicly claimed that sweet_potato is in the green_bottle.
17. Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box.

Based on the above information, we know that Sophia moved the sweet_potato from the red_box to the green_bottle. However, we also know that Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box. Since Sophia knows this information, she may be lying about where she thinks the sweet_potato is. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is K. red_box.
