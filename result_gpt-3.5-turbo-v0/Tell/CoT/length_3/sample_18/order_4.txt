Step 1: Identify the agents involved in the question - William, Aiden, Avery, and Carter.
Step 2: Determine the order of their exits from the office - Avery, Aiden, Carter, William.
Step 3: Determine the location of the cabbage - in the green_crate.
Step 4: Determine who knows the location of the cabbage - Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket, and William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate.
Step 5: Determine who trusts whom - William trusts Carter more than Avery, as Carter exited the office after William.

Based on the assumptions and the story, we can conclude that William thinks that Aiden thinks Avery thinks that the cabbage is in the green_basket. This is because Aiden publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the green_basket, and William trusts Carter more than Avery, so he would believe that Carter knows the true location of the cabbage. Avery made no movements in the office and did not have any private or public interactions that would suggest he knows the location of the cabbage. Therefore, William would not think that Avery knows the location of the cabbage.
