To answer this question, we need to look for any information that tells us where Carter thinks the cabbage is. According to the story, Charlotte privately told Avery that the cabbage is in the green_bucket, and William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate. However, we don't know if Carter trusts William or not. We also know that Carter moved the spinach to the green_treasure_chest, but there is no information about him moving the cabbage.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine where Carter really thinks the cabbage is. The answer is not provided in the options given.
