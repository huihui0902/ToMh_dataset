To answer this question, we need to track the movements and interactions of Aiden, Avery, and Carter regarding the cabbage. According to the story, Avery never made any movements in the office except for the time when he moved the cabbage to the green_crate. Carter moved the spinach from the green_crate to the green_treasure_chest and then Charlotte moved it to the green_bucket. Aiden made no movements in the office except for the time when he publicly claimed that the cabbage is in the green_basket. 

We need to find out where Aiden thinks Avery thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is. Since Aiden made no movements in the office when Avery moved the cabbage to the green_crate, he cannot know where the cabbage is. However, he knows that William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate. Therefore, Aiden can infer that Carter thinks the cabbage is in the green_crate. 

Now we need to find out where Avery thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is. Since Avery moved the cabbage to the green_crate, he knows that the cabbage is in the green_crate. Therefore, he cannot think that the cabbage is in any other place. 

Finally, we need to find out where Aiden thinks Avery thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is. Since Avery knows that the cabbage is in the green_crate, he cannot think that the cabbage is in any other place. Therefore, Aiden cannot think that Avery thinks that the cabbage is in any other place. 

Therefore, the answer is G. green_crate.
