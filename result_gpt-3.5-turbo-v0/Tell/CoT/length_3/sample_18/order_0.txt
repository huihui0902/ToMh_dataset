Step 1: Look for all the statements related to the cabbage.
- Statement 2: The cabbage is in the green_bucket.
- Statement 14: William publicly claimed that cabbage is in the green_envelope.
- Statement 26: The cabbage is in the green_bucket.
- Statement 38: William privately told Carter that the cabbage is in the green_crate.

Step 2: Analyze the statements and eliminate the lies.
- Statement 14 and 38 contradict each other. One of them must be a lie.
- Since William privately told Carter, it is more likely that he told the truth to Carter. Therefore, statement 38 is true and statement 14 is a lie.
- Statement 2 and 26 both claim that the cabbage is in the green_bucket. Therefore, it is likely that the cabbage is really in the green_bucket.

Step 3: Answer the question.
- The correct answer is F. green_bucket.
