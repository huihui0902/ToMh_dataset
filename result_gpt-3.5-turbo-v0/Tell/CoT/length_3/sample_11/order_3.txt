To answer this question, we need to trace Jack's thoughts and assumptions. According to the story, Jack publicly claimed that the spinach is in the green_pantry (step 15). However, Isla privately told Jack that the spinach is in the blue_suitcase (step 16). Therefore, Jack knows that the spinach is not in the green_pantry, but he may or may not know where it actually is.

We also know that Benjamin, Isla, Amelia, and Jack entered the front_yard (step 26), and Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute (step 28). Therefore, Jack exited the front_yard later than Benjamin, and he may trust Benjamin's judgment more than his own.

However, we don't have any information about where Abigail thinks the spinach is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Jack thinks Benjamin thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
