To answer this question, we need to track the movements and interactions of Benjamin and Abigail. According to the story, Abigail made no movements in the sunroom and then exited, while Benjamin made no movements in the sunroom and then exited. Therefore, they were both in the sunroom at the same time, but did not interact with each other. Later, Abigail, Isla, and Jack entered the patio, but Benjamin was not mentioned to be there. Therefore, Benjamin did not witness Abigail's interaction with Isla and Jack in the patio.

The only information we have about Abigail's thoughts on the spinach is that she dislikes it. We also know that Isla moved the spinach to the green_pantry after Abigail exited the sunroom. However, Benjamin was not present for either of these events. Therefore, we cannot determine where Benjamin thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is.
