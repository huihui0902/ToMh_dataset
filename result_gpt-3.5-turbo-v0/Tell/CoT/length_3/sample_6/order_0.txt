To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the orange and the statements made by the agents. According to the story, the orange was initially in the green_box in the laundry. Jacob moved it to the blue_bottle, and then Jackson moved it to the red_container. Isabella later moved it to the blue_bucket in the laundry. Jackson publicly claimed that the orange is in the red_container, but Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container. However, Hannah privately told Isabella that the orange is in the blue_bottle. Therefore, based on the story and assumptions, the orange is actually in the blue_bottle. The answer is D.
