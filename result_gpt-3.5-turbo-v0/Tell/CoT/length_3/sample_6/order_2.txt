To answer this question, we need to track the movements and interactions of Isabella and Owen regarding the orange. According to the story, Isabella publicly claimed that the orange is in the blue_bucket, while Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container. Isabella later moved the orange to the blue_bucket in the laundry. However, we don't have any information about Owen's thoughts on the location of the orange after he privately told Hannah about it. Therefore, we cannot determine where Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is. The answer is unknown.
