To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of Jacob, Isabella, and Owen regarding the orange. 

1. Jacob moved the orange from the green_box to the blue_bottle. 
2. Jackson moved the orange from the blue_bottle to the red_container. 
3. Isabella moved the orange from the red_container to the blue_bucket. 
4. Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container. 

Based on these movements, we know that Jacob last saw the orange in the blue_bottle, but he doesn't know that Jackson moved it to the red_container. Isabella last moved the orange to the blue_bucket, but she doesn't know that Owen told Hannah it's in the red_container. 

Therefore, Jacob thinks Isabella thinks the orange is in the blue_bucket, but in reality, it's in the red_container. 

The answer is C. blue_bucket.
