To determine the location of the persimmon, we need to track its movements based on the story and assumptions given. 

1. The persimmon is initially in the green_bathtub (statement 3). 
2. Emily moves the persimmon to the red_envelope (statement 5). 
3. Mila moves the persimmon to the green_box (statement 7). 
4. Benjamin moves the persimmon to the red_pantry (statement 10). 
5. Therefore, the persimmon is really in the red_pantry (option D). 

The answer is D. red_pantry.
