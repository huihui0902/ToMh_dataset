To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Emily and Mila regarding the persimmon. According to the story, Emily moved the persimmon to the red_envelope, and Mila later moved it to the green_box. However, we don't know what Mila thinks about the location of the persimmon. 

We can infer that Emily trusts Benjamin more than Mila because Benjamin exited the back_yard after Emily. Therefore, Emily might believe Benjamin's claim about the location of the persimmon more than Mila's claim. 

However, we also know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot be sure about anyone's claim. Therefore, we cannot determine where Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is. 

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
