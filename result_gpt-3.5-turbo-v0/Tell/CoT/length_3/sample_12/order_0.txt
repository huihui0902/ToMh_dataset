To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and their private and public interactions related to the spinach. According to the story, Isabella, Avery, Hannah, Noah, and Nathan entered the dining room. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the dining room for 1 minute before exiting. Avery moved the spinach to the red crate and then exited the dining room. Hannah moved the spinach to the green cupboard and then exited the dining room. Finally, Nathan moved the spinach to the green pantry and then exited the dining room. 

Later, Hannah privately told Isabella that the spinach is in the green cupboard, and Avery privately told Noah that the spinach is in the green pantry. Isabella publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green pantry, but we cannot trust her claim as the agents tend to lie. 

Therefore, based on the movements and interactions of the agents, we can conclude that the spinach is actually in the green pantry (option L).
