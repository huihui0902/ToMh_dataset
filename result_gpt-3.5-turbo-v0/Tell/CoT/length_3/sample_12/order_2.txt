To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Hannah and Avery and their private communication. 

1. Isabella, Avery, Hannah, Noah, and Nathan entered the dining room.
2. The spinach is in the green pantry.
3. Isabella made no movements and stayed in the dining room for 1 minute.
4. Isabella exited the dining room.
5. Avery moved the spinach to the red crate.
6. Avery exited the dining room.
7. Hannah moved the spinach to the green cupboard.
8. Hannah exited the dining room.
13. Isabella, Avery, Hannah, Noah, and Nathan entered the waiting room.
15. Hannah privately told Isabella that the spinach is in the green cupboard.
16. Avery privately told Noah that the spinach is in the green pantry.
26. Avery, Noah, and Hannah entered the waiting room.
39. Isabella publicly claimed that the cherry is in the green pantry.
40. Avery privately told Hannah that the cherry is in the green box.

From the story, we know that Hannah moved the spinach to the green cupboard and privately told Isabella about it. Avery moved the spinach to the red crate and privately told Noah that the spinach is in the green pantry. Hannah did not witness Avery's movement, but she knows that Avery exited the dining room after her. Therefore, she would trust Avery more than Noah. 

So, Hannah would think that Avery thinks the spinach is in the green pantry, which is the answer choice (E).
