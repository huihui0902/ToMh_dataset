To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Mila and Owen with respect to the turnip. Mila entered the sunroom with Carter, Owen, Avery, and Isla. She stayed there for a minute and then exited. Owen moved the turnip from the green_pantry to the blue_cupboard and then exited the sunroom. Avery moved the turnip from the blue_cupboard to the red_envelope and then exited the sunroom. Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope. 

We don't have any information about Mila's thoughts or interactions with Owen regarding the turnip. However, we know that Mila was in the sunroom before Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard and Avery moved it to the red_envelope. Therefore, Mila must have seen the turnip in the green_pantry before it was moved. 

Since Mila made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for a minute, she had enough time to observe Owen's movements and infer where he thinks the turnip is. We know that Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard, but we don't know if he saw Avery move it to the red_envelope. Therefore, Mila could think that Owen still thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard. 

The answer is option J. Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard.
