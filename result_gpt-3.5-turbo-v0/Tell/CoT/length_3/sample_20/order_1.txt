To determine where Owen really thinks the turnip is, we need to track the movements of the turnip and the interactions between Owen and the other agents. 

According to the story, the turnip starts in the green_pantry and is moved by Owen to the blue_cupboard. Avery then moves the turnip to the red_envelope. 

In the waiting_room, Avery publicly claims that the turnip is in the blue_pantry, but this claim may not reflect her actual thoughts. Isla privately tells Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope, but we don't know if Owen overhears this conversation. 

There is no further mention of the turnip in the story, so we cannot definitively determine where Owen thinks the turnip is. 

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given options.
