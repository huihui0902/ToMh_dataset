To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and their private and public interactions. According to the story, Carter and Mila entered the sunroom first, followed by Owen, Avery, and Isla. Carter and Mila made no movements and exited the sunroom before Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard and Avery moved it to the red_envelope. Isla made no movements and exited the sunroom last. 

In the waiting room, Avery publicly claimed that the turnip is in the blue_pantry, but Isla privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope. This means that Isla knows the actual location of the turnip, but Carter may or may not know it. 

Later, Isla, Avery, and Carter entered the back yard, where Isla made no movements and exited first, followed by Avery who also made no movements. Carter then moved the persimmon to the red_box before exiting. 

In the waiting room again, Carter publicly claimed that grapes are in the blue_bucket, but Avery privately told Owen that the grapes are in the red_basket. This means that Avery knows the actual location of the grapes, but Carter may or may not know it. 

Based on these movements and interactions, we can conclude that Isla thinks that Carter thinks that Mila thinks that Owen thinks the turnip is in the red_envelope. Therefore, the answer is D. red_bottle.
