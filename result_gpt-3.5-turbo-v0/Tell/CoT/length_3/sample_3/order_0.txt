To determine where the spinach really is, we need to follow the movements of each agent and their private and public interactions. 

- Jackson moved the spinach from the red_container to the green_crate, but then moved it back to the red_drawer after Ella privately told him that the spinach is in the red_crate. 
- Jack then moved the spinach from the red_drawer to the blue_drawer. 
- Ella then moved the spinach from the blue_drawer to the red_drawer. 

Therefore, the spinach is in the red_drawer. The answer is M. red_drawer.
