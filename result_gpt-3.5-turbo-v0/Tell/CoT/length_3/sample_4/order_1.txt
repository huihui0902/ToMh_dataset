To answer this question, we need to track Amelia's movements and interactions with other agents. According to the story, Amelia moved the corn to the green_drawer and publicly claimed that the corn is in the green_bottle. However, Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope. We know that Amelia tends to lie, so we cannot trust her public claim. We also know that Amelia trusts Abigail because Abigail exited the hallway after Amelia. Therefore, we can infer that Amelia really thinks the corn is in the green_envelope, which is option G.
