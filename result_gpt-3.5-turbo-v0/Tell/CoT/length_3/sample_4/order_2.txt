To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the corn and the interactions between Nathan and Amelia. According to the story, Nathan moved the corn to the red_envelope, and Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope. However, Amelia publicly claimed that the corn is in the green_bottle. This means that Amelia is lying about the location of the corn. 

Since Nathan exited the hallway before Amelia made her claim, he would not have heard her public claim. However, Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope, and Nathan and Amelia were both in the lounge together with Abigail. Therefore, Nathan could have overheard their private conversation and knows that Amelia actually thinks the corn is in the green_envelope. 

Therefore, the answer is G. green_envelope.
