This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. We need to trace the movements of the corn and the agents to determine where Alexander thinks Lily thinks Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is. 

Step 1: Start with the last piece of information we have about the corn. Amelia privately told Nathan that the corn is in the green_cupboard. 

Step 2: Trace back to where Nathan was when he received this information. Nathan was in the waiting_room with Abigail and Amelia. 

Step 3: Trace back to where Amelia was before she told Nathan about the corn. She was in the bedroom with Alexander, Lily, and Nathan. 

Step 4: Trace back to where Lily was before Amelia left the bedroom. She had moved the green_pepper to the red_container. 

Step 5: Trace back to where Nathan was before Lily moved the green_pepper. He had exited the bedroom. 

Step 6: Trace back to where Alexander was before Nathan left the bedroom. He had made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute. 

Step 7: Therefore, Alexander thinks Lily thinks Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the red_container. 

The answer is B. red_container.
