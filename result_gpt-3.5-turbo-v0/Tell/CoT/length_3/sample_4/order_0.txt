To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the corn and the statements made by the agents. According to the story, Nathan moved the corn to the red_envelope, then Lily moved it to the green_envelope, then Amelia moved it to the green_drawer, then Alexander moved it to the green_box, and finally Abigail moved it back to the green_bottle. In the waiting_room, Amelia publicly claimed that the corn is in the green_bottle, but Abigail privately told her that it is in the green_envelope. Since Abigail moved the corn to the green_bottle after moving it to the green_envelope, we can assume that she is lying to Amelia in the private conversation. Therefore, the corn is actually in the green_bottle. The answer is F. green_bottle.
