The question is asking about Ava's thoughts regarding William's thoughts on the location of the cherry. To answer this question, we need to track William's movements and interactions with other agents. 

According to the story, William entered the cellar and made no movements for 1 minute before exiting. He then publicly claimed that the cherry is in the blue_container. Later, Amelia privately told William that the cherry is in the green_pantry. William then entered the cellar again with Logan and Amelia, and the cherry was found in the green_bucket. Logan privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container. 

Based on this information, we can infer that William initially thought the cherry was in the blue_container, but after Amelia's private communication, he knew that it was actually in the green_pantry. Ava was not present during William's private conversation with Amelia, so she would not know that William's belief had changed. Therefore, Ava would think that William still believes the cherry is in the blue_container. 

The answer is B. blue_bathtub.
