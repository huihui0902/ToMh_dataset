This question requires a bit of unraveling, but we can break it down step by step. 

1. Where does Amelia think Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is? 

2. Let's start with William's claim in step 16: "The cherry is in the blue_container." 

3. However, in step 17, Amelia privately tells William that the cherry is actually in the green_pantry. 

4. Logan, Amelia, and William then enter the cellar in step 18, and find that the cherry is indeed in the green_bucket (step 19). 

5. Logan then moves the cherry to the green_pantry (step 20), and Amelia moves it to the green_basket (step 22). 

6. In step 38, Ava publicly claims that the cherry is in the green_basket. 

7. However, in step 39, Logan privately tells Amelia that the cherry is actually in the blue_container. 

8. So, where does Amelia think Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is? 

9. We know that William publicly claimed the cherry is in the blue_container, but Amelia knows that it's actually in the green_pantry. 

10. Logan privately tells Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container, so she knows that Logan knows the true location of the cherry. 

11. However, Ava publicly claims that the cherry is in the green_basket, so Amelia may think that Ava believes the cherry is there. 

12. Therefore, Amelia may think that Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is in the green_basket (option N). 

So the answer is N. green_basket.
