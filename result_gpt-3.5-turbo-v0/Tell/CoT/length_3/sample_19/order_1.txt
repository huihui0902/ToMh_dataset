To answer this question, we need to track William's movements and interactions with other agents. According to the story, William entered the cellar and made no movements, then exited the cellar. Later, in the waiting room, he publicly claimed that the cherry is in the blue_container. However, Amelia privately told him that the cherry is in the green_pantry, and he later entered the cellar again with Logan and Amelia. The cherry was found in the green_basket, and Ava publicly claimed that it is in the green_basket. Logan privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container.

Based on these events, we can infer that William is lying about his belief that the cherry is in the blue_container. He was told by Amelia that it is in the green_pantry, and he entered the cellar again with Logan and Amelia, where they found the cherry in the green_basket. Therefore, the correct answer is N. green_basket.
