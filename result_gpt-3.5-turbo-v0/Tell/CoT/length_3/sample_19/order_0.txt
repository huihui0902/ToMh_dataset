To answer this question, we need to follow the movements of the cherry and the agents. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The cherry is initially in the cellar.
2. Logan moves the cherry to the green_bucket.
3. Amelia moves the cherry to the green_pantry.
4. Logan privately tells Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container.
5. Therefore, the cherry is actually in the blue_container.

The answer is L. blue_container.
