This question requires a bit of deduction and inference. We need to figure out where Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. 

First, we know that William publicly claimed that the cherry is in the blue_container, but Amelia privately told William that the cherry is in the green_pantry. This means that William knows the true location of the cherry, but he may or may not be lying about it.

Next, we need to figure out where Ava thinks the cherry is. We know that Ava dislikes the beans and moved the cherry to the green_bucket. However, we don't know if she knows the true location of the cherry or if she's lying about it.

Finally, we need to figure out where Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is. We know that Logan privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container, so he knows the true location of the cherry. However, we don't know if he trusts William's public claim or if he thinks William is lying.

Based on these assumptions, we can eliminate some options. We know that the cherry is not in the blue_bathtub, red_pantry, red_crate, red_basket, blue_treasure_chest, blue_cupboard, red_bottle, red_bucket, or green_envelope. These locations are either never mentioned in the story or are contradicted by the events that take place.

We also know that the cherry ends up in the green_basket, but we don't know if Ava knows this or if she's lying about it. Therefore, we can't say for sure that Logan thinks Ava thinks the cherry is in the green_basket.

However, we do know that Logan moved the cherry to the green_pantry and privately told Amelia that the cherry is in the blue_container. This means that he trusts his own knowledge of the cherry's location over William's public claim. Therefore, it's likely that he thinks Ava also knows the true location of the cherry and is not lying about it.

The only option that fits this criteria is K. green_pantry. Therefore, the answer is K. green_pantry.
