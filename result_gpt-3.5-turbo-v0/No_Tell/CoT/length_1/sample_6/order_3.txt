To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the apple and the agents' preferences. We know that Hannah moved the apple to the blue_cupboard and likes the blue_drawer. Jack moved the apple to the green_drawer and exited the closet after Hannah. Lily moved the apple to the red_box and exited the closet after Jack. Therefore, Jack trusts Hannah more than Lily. Logan and Aiden made no movements and have no impact on the answer.

Now, we need to determine where Jack thinks Hannah thinks Lily thinks the apple is. Since Jack trusts Hannah more than Lily, he will assume that Hannah's actions are more truthful than Lily's. Therefore, we need to look at where Hannah moved the apple to, which is the blue_cupboard. We also know that Hannah likes the blue_drawer. 

Therefore, Jack thinks that Hannah thinks Lily thinks the apple is in the blue_drawer (option D).
