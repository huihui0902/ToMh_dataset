To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the apple and the agents in the story. We know that Hannah moved the apple from the green_bathtub to the blue_cupboard, and Jack then moved it to the green_drawer. Lily then moved the apple to the red_box. Logan and Aiden made no movements with the apple. Hannah likes the blue_drawer, but we don't have any information about Lily's preferences. 

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Lily may have heard about the apple's location from Hannah or Jack before she moved it to the red_box. However, we don't know if she trusts their information or if she has her own thoughts about where the apple should be. 

The only definitive information we have is that the apple was last seen in the red_box when all the agents exited the closet and entered the waiting_room. Therefore, the answer to the question is N. red_box.
