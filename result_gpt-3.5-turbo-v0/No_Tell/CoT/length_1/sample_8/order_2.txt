The question is asking for Chloe's thoughts about Sophia's thoughts on the location of the corn. To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each character and their interactions with each other. 

1. Owen, Ella, Chloe, Sophia, and Noah entered the crawlspace.
2. The corn is in the green_crate.
3. Owen made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
4. Owen exited the crawlspace.
5. Ella made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
6. Ella exited the crawlspace.
7. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
8. Ella dislikes the corn.
9. Chloe exited the crawlspace.
10. Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase.
11. Sophia exited the crawlspace.
12. Noah made no movements and stayed in the crawlspace for 1 minute.
13. Noah exited the crawlspace.
14. Owen, Ella, Chloe, Sophia, and Noah entered the waiting_room.

Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Chloe made no movements in the crawlspace and stayed there for one minute. We also know that Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase before exiting the crawlspace. 

Since Chloe and Sophia were both in the crawlspace, Chloe could have inferred Sophia's thoughts on the location of the corn. However, we do not have any information about their private or public interactions. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is located. The answer is not provided in the options given.
