This question requires a lot of careful reading and tracking of each character's movements and statements. We know that Ella moved the spinach from the red bottle to the green basket, and Benjamin later moved it to the green envelope. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute, while Jack and Emma also stayed in the attic for 1 minute each. 

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Aiden can only infer Ella's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private/public interactions. We also know that agents tend to lie, so we can't trust what they say to each other. 

Since Aiden made no movements after Ella moved the spinach, he would not have seen where she put it. However, he knows that Benjamin moved it to the green envelope. We don't have any information about interactions between Aiden, Ella, and Emma, so we can't infer what Ella thinks Emma thinks about the spinach's location. 

Therefore, the answer is: we don't have enough information to answer this question.
