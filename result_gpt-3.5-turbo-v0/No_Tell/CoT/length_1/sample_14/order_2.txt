To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the lime and the agents and their thoughts. 

1. Emily, Jack, Avery, Aiden, and Abigail entered the playroom.
2. The lime is in the green_envelope.
3. Emily moved the lime to the blue_pantry.
4. Emily exited the playroom.
5. Jack moved the lime to the blue_suitcase.
6. Jack exited the playroom.
7. Avery made no movements and stayed in the playroom for 1 minute.
8. Avery exited the playroom.
9. Emily likes the green_crate.
10. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the playroom for 1 minute.
11. Aiden exited the playroom.
12. Avery likes the red_basket.
13. Abigail moved the lime to the green_envelope.
14. Abigail exited the playroom.
15. Emily, Jack, Avery, Aiden, and Abigail entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions, we know that Avery can only infer Abigail's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. We also know that agents tend to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts. 

We don't have any information about Avery and Abigail being in the same place or having private interactions, so we need to look for any public interactions or movements that might give us a clue. 

The lime starts in the green_envelope and is moved by Emily to the blue_pantry, then by Jack to the blue_suitcase, and finally by Abigail back to the green_envelope. Avery makes no movements and stays in the playroom for 1 minute. 

We know that Emily likes the green_crate and Avery likes the red_basket, but we don't have any information about Abigail's preferences. 

Based on the movements of the lime and the fact that Avery makes no movements, it's possible that Avery didn't see Abigail move the lime back to the green_envelope. Therefore, Avery might still think that the lime is in the blue_suitcase, which is the last place he saw it. 

Therefore, the answer is (M) blue_suitcase.
