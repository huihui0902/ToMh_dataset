To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the lime and the agents. Emily moved the lime from the green_envelope to the blue_pantry, and then Jack moved it from the blue_pantry to the blue_suitcase. Abigail then moved the lime from the blue_suitcase to the green_envelope. Therefore, the lime is really in the green_envelope. The answer is K. green_envelope.
