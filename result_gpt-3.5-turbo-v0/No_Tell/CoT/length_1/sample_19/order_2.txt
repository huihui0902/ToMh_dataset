To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Emily and Hannah and their possible interactions. Emily entered the staircase first and made no movements before exiting. Hannah entered the staircase last and made no movements before exiting. Therefore, Hannah did not have any interaction with Emily in the staircase. However, both Emily and Hannah entered the waiting room together. Since we do not have any information about their private or public interactions in the waiting room, we cannot infer what Hannah thinks about Emily's thoughts on the location of the asparagus. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the given information. The correct answer is: Not enough information provided.
