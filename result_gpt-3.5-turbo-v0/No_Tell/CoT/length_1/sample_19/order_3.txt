The question is asking about Amelia's thoughts on Hannah's thoughts on Emily's thoughts about the location of the asparagus. To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each person and their possible interactions. 

1. Emily, Abigail, Amelia, Elizabeth, and Hannah entered the staircase together.
2. The asparagus is in the green bottle.
3. Emily made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
4. Emily exited the staircase.
5. Abigail made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
6. Abigail exited the staircase.
7. Amelia made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
8. Amelia exited the staircase.
9. Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
10. Elizabeth exited the staircase.
11. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
12. Hannah exited the staircase.
13. Emily, Abigail, Amelia, Elizabeth, and Hannah entered the waiting room.

Based on the assumptions, we know that Amelia can only infer Hannah's thoughts if they had private or public interactions. However, there is no mention of any interactions between Amelia and Hannah. Therefore, we cannot determine where Amelia thinks Hannah thinks Emily thinks the asparagus is. 

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
