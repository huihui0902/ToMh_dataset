This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Amelia think the watermelon is?
According to step 11, Amelia moved the watermelon to the blue_container before exiting the back_yard. Therefore, Amelia thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.

2. Where does Amelia think Avery thinks the watermelon is?
Avery made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Avery did not see where the watermelon was moved to. Amelia moved the watermelon to the blue_container after Avery left the back_yard. Therefore, Amelia knows that Avery did not see where the watermelon was moved to. Since Avery made no movements, he did not interact with anyone else who might have seen where the watermelon was moved to. Therefore, Amelia thinks that Avery has no idea where the watermelon is.

3. Where does Amelia think Owen thinks the watermelon is?
Owen made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Owen did not see where the watermelon was moved to. However, Owen was in the back_yard at the same time as Ella, who moved the watermelon to the red_pantry before exiting. Therefore, Owen might have seen where the watermelon was moved to. Since Owen made no movements, he did not interact with anyone else who might have seen where the watermelon was moved to. Therefore, Amelia thinks that Owen might know where the watermelon is, but she is not sure where he thinks it is.

4. Where does Amelia think Ella thinks the watermelon is?
Ella moved the watermelon to the red_pantry before exiting the back_yard. Therefore, Ella knows that the watermelon is not in the blue_container. However, Ella did not see where Amelia moved the watermelon to after she left the back_yard. Therefore, Ella might think that the watermelon is still in the blue_container. Since Amelia knows that Avery has no idea where the watermelon is and Owen might know where it is, but she is not sure where he thinks it is, she cannot infer what Ella thinks about the location of the watermelon. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.

In conclusion, the answer is not provided in the options given.
