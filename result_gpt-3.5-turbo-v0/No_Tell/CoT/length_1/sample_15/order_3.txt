This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Ella think Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is?

2. We know that the watermelon is in the blue_container (from statement 2).

3. Avery made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute (statement 3).

4. Avery exited the back_yard (statement 4).

5. Owen made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute (statement 5).

6. Owen exited the back_yard (statement 6).

7. Ella moved the watermelon to the red_pantry (statement 7).

8. Ella exited the back_yard (statement 8).

9. Ava made no movements and stayed in the back_yard for 1 minute (statement 9).

10. Ava exited the back_yard (statement 10).

11. Amelia moved the watermelon to the blue_container (statement 11).

12. Amelia exited the back_yard (statement 12).

13. Avery, Owen, Ella, Ava and Amelia entered the waiting_room (statement 13).

Based on these statements, we can infer that Ella knows the watermelon was originally in the blue_container, but she moved it to the red_pantry. Owen and Avery were both in the back_yard before Ella moved the watermelon, but we don't know where they think it is. 

Since Ella and Owen were both in the back_yard at some point, Ella can infer Owen's thoughts based on the assumptions. However, we don't have any information about what Owen thinks, so we can't answer the question.

Therefore, the answer is: Insufficient information to answer the question.
