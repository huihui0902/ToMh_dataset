To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Avery and the watermelon. Avery entered the back_yard and made no movements before exiting. Therefore, Avery did not move the watermelon. Ella moved the watermelon to the red_pantry after Avery exited. Owen entered the back_yard after Avery and made no movements before exiting. Therefore, Owen did not move the watermelon either. Amelia moved the watermelon to the blue_container after Ava exited. 

Since Owen did not move the watermelon and Avery did not move the watermelon, Owen would think that Avery thinks the watermelon is still in the blue_container where it was originally placed. Therefore, the answer is L. blue_container.
