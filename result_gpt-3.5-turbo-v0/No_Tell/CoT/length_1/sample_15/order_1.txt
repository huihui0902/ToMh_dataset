To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions with the watermelon. Avery entered the back_yard with the group, made no movements, and exited the back_yard before any interactions with the watermelon occurred. Therefore, Avery did not have any direct interaction with the watermelon and did not witness its movement. We cannot infer Avery's thoughts on the location of the watermelon based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the options given.
