To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the cabbage and the agents. Amelia moved the cabbage from the red_container to the green_envelope, and Abigail moved it from the green_envelope to the green_crate. Charlotte then moved it from the green_crate to the blue_crate. Carter and Nathan made no movements and stayed in the laundry for 1 minute before exiting.

Since Nathan exited the laundry after Abigail, he would tend to trust her more than Amelia or Charlotte. However, we don't know if Abigail made any claims about the location of the cabbage before she exited. Therefore, we cannot infer where Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the cabbage is.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
