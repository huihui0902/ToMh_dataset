To answer this question, we need to analyze the movements and actions of each character in the story and their possible interactions with each other. We know that the plum was initially in the red_pantry, but Evelyn moved it to the green_bucket. Nathan saw a mouse and Evelyn saw a monkey, but we don't know if they interacted with each other or with any other character. William made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute, but we don't know if he saw the plum or if he interacted with any other character who saw the plum. Emily disliked the plum and made no movements before exiting the pantry. Jacob moved the plum back to the red_pantry before exiting the pantry with the other characters.

Based on these assumptions, we can infer that William may have seen the plum in the red_pantry before Jacob moved it back. However, we cannot be certain of this as William made no movements and we don't know if he interacted with any other character who saw the plum. Therefore, the answer to the question is A. red_drawer, as this is the only option that corresponds to the red_pantry where the plum was initially located.
