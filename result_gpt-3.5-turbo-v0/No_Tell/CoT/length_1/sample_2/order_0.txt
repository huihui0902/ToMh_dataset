To solve this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their trust level towards each other. 

1. Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box. 
2. Carter made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute. 
3. Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container. 
4. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute. 
5. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute. 

Based on the given information, the tomato was last seen in the blue_container, which was moved by Elizabeth. However, we also need to consider the trust level of the agents towards each other. 

Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box, but we don't know if she saw where the tomato originally was. Carter made no movements, so he doesn't have any information about the tomato's location. Hannah and Jacob also made no movements, so they don't have any information either. 

Therefore, the only agent who moved the tomato and has information about its location is Elizabeth. Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, we can assume that Isabella, Carter, Hannah, and Jacob would trust Elizabeth's claim about the tomato's location. 

Therefore, the answer is E. blue_container.
