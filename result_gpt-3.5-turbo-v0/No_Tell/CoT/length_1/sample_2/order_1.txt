To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the tomato and the agents. Isabella moved the tomato from the green_bottle to the green_box, then Elizabeth moved it from the green_box to the blue_container. We know that Carter made no movements, Hannah made no movements, and Jacob lost his watch. Therefore, Jacob did not move the tomato. 

Based on the given information, Jacob was in the bedroom when Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box and he was still in the bedroom when Elizabeth moved it to the blue_container. We do not have any information that suggests Jacob had a private or public interaction with any other agent about the location of the tomato. 

Therefore, we can assume that Jacob thinks the tomato is still in the green_box, as that was the last place he saw it before leaving the bedroom. 

The answer is D. green_box.
