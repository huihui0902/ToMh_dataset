To solve this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions with each other. From the story, we know that Elizabeth and Ava did not move the banana, Abigail moved it to the blue_bottle, Ella did not move it, and Owen moved it to the green_envelope. We also know that Owen saw a cat and Elizabeth stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. 

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Owen trusts Elizabeth's judgment more than his own since she exited the bedroom after him. Therefore, Owen thinks that Elizabeth thinks the banana is in the green_envelope. 

However, the question asks where Owen thinks Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is. Since Ella did not move the banana, we can assume that Owen thinks Ella has no opinion on where the banana is. Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle, so Owen thinks that Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is B. blue_bathtub.
