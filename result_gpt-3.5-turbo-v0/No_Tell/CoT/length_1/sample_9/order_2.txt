To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and the location of the banana. From the story, we know that Elizabeth, Ava, Abigail, Ella, and Owen entered the bedroom. The banana was initially in the green_envelope. Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Ava also made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle before exiting. Ella made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Owen saw a cat and then moved the banana back to the green_envelope before exiting. Finally, all five agents entered the waiting_room.

Since Ella never moved the banana or saw anyone else move it, she cannot know for sure where the banana is. However, she can infer where Abigail thinks the banana is based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves. From the story, we know that Abigail exited the bedroom before Owen did. Therefore, Ella would likely think that Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle, where Abigail left it before exiting the bedroom. 

Therefore, the answer is F. blue_bottle.
