To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Mila and William and their interactions with the melon. Mila entered the garden with William and the others, but made no movements and stayed for only one minute before exiting. William also made no movements and stayed for one minute before exiting. Therefore, Mila and William did not interact with each other or the melon while in the garden. 

Next, we need to look at the movements of the other agents. Ava moved the melon to the green_basket, and Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle. Liam made no movements and stayed in the garden for one minute, but saw a mouse. 

Since Mila did not interact with the melon and William made no movements, we cannot determine where William thinks the melon is based on their actions alone. However, we can make some inferences based on the actions of the other agents. 

Ava moved the melon to the green_basket, but we do not know if William saw this happen or if he was in the garden at the time. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle, but we do not know if William saw this happen or if he was still in the garden at the time. Liam saw a mouse, but we do not know if he saw the melon or where he thinks it is. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Mila thinks William thinks the melon is based on the given information. The answer is unknown.
