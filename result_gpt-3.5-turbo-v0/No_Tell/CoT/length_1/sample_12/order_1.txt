To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions with the melon. Mila did not move the melon and left the garden before any other agent moved the melon. Ava moved the melon to the green_basket before leaving the garden. Liam did not move the melon and left the garden after Ava. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle before leaving the garden. William did not move the melon and left the garden after Ella. 

Since William did not move the melon, he must rely on the information he received from the other agents. Ava moved the melon to the green_basket before leaving the garden, and Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle before leaving the garden. Since William trusts agents who exited the garden after him, he would trust Ella's claim that the melon is in the red_bottle. Therefore, William really thinks the melon is in the red_bottle (option I). 

The correct answer is I. red_bottle.
