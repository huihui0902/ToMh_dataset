To answer this question, we need to look at the movements and actions of Liam and Alexander. Liam entered the patio with Mila, Emma, Alexander, and Avery. He made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. Alexander moved the lettuce to the blue_container before exiting the patio. 

Based on the assumption that an agent tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself, we can assume that Liam trusts Alexander's actions. Therefore, Liam really thinks that the lettuce is in the blue_container. 

The answer is I. blue_container.
