To answer this question, we need to look at the movements and actions of each character in the story. We know that the corn was initially in the blue_treasure_chest, but Charlotte moved it to the green_crate. Jackson, Avery, Liam, and Benjamin all entered the cellar, but only Jackson and Avery stayed for one minute without making any movements. All four characters then exited the cellar and later entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Benjamin can only infer the thoughts of other characters if he has been in the same place as them or has had private or public interactions with them. We also know that each character tends to lie, so we cannot trust what they say to others.

Since Benjamin did not make any movements in the cellar and did not have any private or public interactions with Charlotte or Avery, he cannot be sure where the corn is. However, he may trust Avery's claim that he likes the blue_bathtub, which could lead him to believe that the corn is in the blue_container. Therefore, the answer is O. blue_container.
