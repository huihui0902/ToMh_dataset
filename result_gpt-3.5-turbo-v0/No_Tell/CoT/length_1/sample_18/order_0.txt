To solve this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their statements. According to the story, Jackson, Charlotte, Avery, Liam, and Benjamin entered the cellar. The corn was initially in the blue_treasure_chest. Jackson made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. Charlotte moved the corn to the green_crate and then exited the cellar. Avery made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. Liam made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute before exiting. Finally, all five agents entered the waiting_room.

We can eliminate options C, F, J, M, and N as they were not mentioned in the story. We can also eliminate options D, H, and L as there was no mention of any agent interacting with or mentioning them. Option E can be eliminated as Avery made no mention of the blue_bathtub. Option G can be eliminated as there was no mention of any drawer. Option I can be eliminated as there was no mention of any red_crate. Option K can be eliminated as there was no mention of any treasure chest other than the blue_treasure_chest.

Therefore, the only option left is B, green_crate, as Charlotte moved the corn to the green_crate before exiting the cellar. So, the corn is really in the green_crate. The answer is B.
