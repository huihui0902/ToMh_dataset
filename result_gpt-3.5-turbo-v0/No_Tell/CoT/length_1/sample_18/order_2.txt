To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions with each other. We know that Jackson entered the cellar with the others, made no movements, and exited after 1 minute. Charlotte moved the corn to the green crate and then exited. Avery made no movements and exited after 1 minute. Liam and Benjamin also made no movements and exited after 1 minute. Finally, all five agents entered the waiting room.

Since Jackson exited before Benjamin, he would tend to trust Benjamin's thoughts about the location of the corn. However, we don't have any information about Benjamin's thoughts or interactions with Jackson. We only know that he made no movements in the cellar and exited after 1 minute.

Therefore, we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks the corn is located based on the given information. The answer is unknown.
