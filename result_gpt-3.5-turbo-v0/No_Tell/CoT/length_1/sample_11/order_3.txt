This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Chloe, Benjamin, Alexander, Ella, and Elizabeth entered the study.
2. The orange is in the red_box.
3. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
4. Alexander lost his phone.
5. Chloe exited the study.
6. Benjamin moved the orange to the red_envelope.
7. Benjamin exited the study.
8. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
9. Alexander exited the study.
10. Ella made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute.
11. Benjamin saw a cat.
12. Ella exited the study.
13. Elizabeth moved the orange to the red_box.
14. Elizabeth exited the study.
15. Chloe, Benjamin, Alexander, Ella, and Elizabeth entered the waiting_room.

Based on the story and assumptions, we know that Chloe can only infer Elizabeth's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. We also know that Chloe tends to lie, so we cannot trust what she says. 

We need to determine where Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks the orange is. We know that Elizabeth moved the orange to the red_box, but we don't know what she thinks about where Ella thinks the orange is. 

We need to look for clues in the story. Ella made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute, so she didn't move the orange. Benjamin moved the orange to the red_envelope, but we don't know what he thinks about where Ella thinks the orange is. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the study for 1 minute, so he didn't move the orange either. 

The only clue we have is that Benjamin saw a cat, but this doesn't help us determine where Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks the orange is. 

Therefore, we cannot answer this question based on the information given in the story and assumptions. The answer is unknown.
