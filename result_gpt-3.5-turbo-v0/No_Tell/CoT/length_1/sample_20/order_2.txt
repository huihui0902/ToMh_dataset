To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their exit order. Mila moved the watermelon to the red_box and then exited the front_yard. Ava moved the watermelon to the green_bottle and then exited the front_yard. Emily moved the watermelon to the blue_bathtub and then exited the front_yard. Evelyn and Jacob made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Jacob exited the front_yard after Ava and can trust her more than Mila or Emily. 

Based on this information, we can conclude that Jacob thinks Ava thinks the watermelon is in the green_bottle, as that was the last place Ava moved it before exiting the front_yard. Therefore, the answer is D. green_bottle.
