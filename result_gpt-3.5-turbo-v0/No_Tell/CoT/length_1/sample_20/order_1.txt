To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the watermelon and the agents. Mila moved the watermelon to the red_box, then Ava moved it to the green_bottle, and finally, Emily moved it to the blue_bathtub. Evelyn and Jacob made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute before exiting. Mila, Ava, Emily, Evelyn, and Jacob then entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Ava can only infer the location of the watermelon based on her own observations and any private or public interactions she had with the other agents. We also know that agents tend to lie, so we cannot trust any public claims made by the agents.

Therefore, the answer to the question is E. red_box, as that was the last known location of the watermelon before Ava moved it. We cannot trust Ava's claim that she moved it to the green_bottle, as she could be lying.
