To solve this question, we need to look for clues in the story that tell us where the potato actually is and what Logan's thoughts might be. We know that the potato was initially in the green_envelope, but Charlotte moved it to the red_bottle. Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute before exiting. We also know that Logan tends to lie and that he may trust agents who exited the room later than himself.

Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, C, E, H, I, K, L, M, O as they do not involve the red_bottle where Charlotte moved the potato. We can also eliminate options D, F, and N as there is no indication in the story that the potato is in a blue container.

This leaves us with options B and J. Logan made no movements while in the patio, so he did not move the potato to the red_container himself. However, he may have seen Charlotte move the potato and know that it is now in the red_bottle. Therefore, the correct answer is option N, red_bottle.
