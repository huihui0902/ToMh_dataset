To solve this question, we need to track the movements of each character and their interactions. Here are the steps:

1. Logan, Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the patio together.
2. The potato is in the green_envelope.
3. Charlotte likes the red_bottle.
4. Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
5. Logan exited the patio.
6. Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle.
7. Charlotte exited the patio.
8. Hannah made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
9. Hannah exited the patio.
10. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
11. Benjamin exited the patio.
12. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute.
13. Evelyn exited the patio.
14. Logan, Charlotte, Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn entered the waiting_room together.

Based on the assumption that agents tend to lie, we cannot trust what they say. Therefore, we need to infer their thoughts based on their actions and interactions.

Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle, so she knows where the potato is. Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, so he doesn't know where the potato is. Hannah, Benjamin, and Evelyn also made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, so they don't know where the potato is either.

Charlotte likes the red_bottle, but we don't know if Benjamin knows this. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, so he didn't see Charlotte move the potato to the red_bottle. However, Charlotte exited the patio after moving the potato, so Benjamin could have seen her and inferred that the potato is in the red_bottle.

Logan exited the patio before Charlotte moved the potato, so he doesn't know where the potato is. However, Charlotte exited the patio after Logan, so Benjamin could have seen her and inferred that Logan doesn't know where the potato is.

Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust a later-exiting agent, Benjamin may trust Charlotte's inference that Logan doesn't know where the potato is. Therefore, Benjamin may think that the potato is not in the green_pantry (where Logan may have put it), but rather in the red_container (where Charlotte moved it).

Therefore, the answer is B. red_container.
