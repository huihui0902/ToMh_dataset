To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Logan and Charlotte with respect to the potato and the red bottle. We know that Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute, while Charlotte moved the potato to the red bottle before exiting the patio. Therefore, Logan did not see Charlotte move the potato to the red bottle. 

Since Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute after Logan exited, he did not see Logan leave the patio. Therefore, he does not know that Logan did not see Charlotte move the potato to the red bottle. 

However, we know that Charlotte likes the red bottle, so it is possible that Benjamin thinks Logan thinks the potato is in the red bottle. Therefore, the answer is N. red_bottle.
