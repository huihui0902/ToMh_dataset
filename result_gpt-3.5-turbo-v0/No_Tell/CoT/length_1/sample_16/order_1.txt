To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the carrot and the agents. Isabella moved the carrot from the red_container to the blue_container. Then, Alexander moved the carrot from the blue_container to the green_bathtub. Finally, Logan moved the carrot from the green_bathtub back to the red_container. William made no movements in the cellar, but he exited after Evelyn and before Alexander. Therefore, he could have heard Evelyn's and Alexander's movements and claims about the carrot's location. Since Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub and Logan moved it back to the red_container, it's possible that William thinks the carrot is still in the green_bathtub, but it's also possible that he thinks it's back in the red_container. However, since William exited the cellar after Evelyn and before Alexander, he may trust Alexander's claim more than Evelyn's. Therefore, the most likely answer is C. green_bathtub.
