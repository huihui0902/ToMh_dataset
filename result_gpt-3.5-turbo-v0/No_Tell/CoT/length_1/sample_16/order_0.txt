To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the carrot and the agents. According to the story, the carrot was initially in the red_container (Step 2). Isabella moved the carrot to the blue_container (Step 3), and then Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub (Step 11). Finally, Logan moved the carrot back to the red_container (Step 13). Therefore, the carrot is really in the red_container (Option B).
