To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Isabella, Logan, Alexander, Evelyn, and William and the location of the carrot. We know that Isabella moved the carrot from the red_container to the blue_container, and Alexander moved the carrot from the blue_container to the green_bathtub, and Logan moved the carrot from the green_bathtub to the red_container. Evelyn made no movements, and William made no movements, so they did not move the carrot. Therefore, the carrot is in the red_container at the end of the story. 

Now we need to determine where Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot is. Since Evelyn and William were both in the cellar, and Evelyn exited the cellar after William, she would tend to trust William's judgment more than her own. Since the carrot is in the red_container, we need to look for any clues that William may have thought the carrot was in the red_container. 

The story does not provide any direct information about William's thoughts on the location of the carrot. However, we know that Logan likes the green_bucket and the green_drawer, but he moved the carrot to the red_container. This suggests that the carrot was not in the green_bucket or the green_drawer, and William may have known this. Additionally, Isabella moved the carrot from the red_container to the blue_container, so William may have thought the carrot was originally in the red_container. 

Based on this reasoning, we can conclude that Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot is in the red_container. Therefore, the answer is B. red_container.
