To solve this question, we need to work backwards from Owen to Noah, then to Hannah, then to Jack, and finally to the location of the eggplant. 

According to the story, Owen moved the eggplant to the green_basket before exiting the pantry. Therefore, Owen thinks the eggplant is in the green_basket. 

Noah lost his gloves and exited the pantry before Owen. Therefore, Owen trusts Noah's claim that the eggplant is in the green_envelope. 

Hannah moved the eggplant to the blue_cupboard before exiting the pantry. Therefore, Noah thinks Hannah thinks the eggplant is in the blue_cupboard. 

Jack moved the eggplant to the green_bathtub before exiting the pantry. Therefore, Hannah thinks Jack thinks the eggplant is in the green_bathtub. 

Therefore, Owen thinks Jack thinks Hannah thinks Noah thinks the eggplant is in the green_envelope (option F).
