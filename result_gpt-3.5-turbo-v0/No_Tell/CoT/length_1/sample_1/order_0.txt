To answer this question, we need to follow the movements of the agents and determine where the lettuce ended up. Avery initially moved the lettuce to the green bathtub, then Charlotte moved it to the blue pantry, and finally, Owen moved it back to the green drawer. Therefore, the lettuce is really in the green drawer. The answer is K. green_drawer.
