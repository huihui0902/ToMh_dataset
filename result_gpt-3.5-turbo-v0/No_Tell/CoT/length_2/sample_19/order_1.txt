To answer this question, we need to track Jackson's movements and any interactions he had with other agents. According to the story, Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate and then exited the laundry. He later entered the hall with Nathan and Amelia, where he moved the onion to the red_envelope and saw a mouse. Amelia then exited the hall, and Jackson lost his phone. Finally, Jackson, Nathan, and Amelia entered the waiting_room.

Based on these movements and interactions, we can infer that Jackson did not have any private or public interactions with Sophia, who moved the tomato to the blue_cupboard before exiting the laundry. Therefore, he would not know that the tomato was moved to the blue_cupboard. Additionally, he did not have any interactions with Charlotte, who made no movements in the laundry, or with Nathan, who moved the tomato to the blue_container after Jackson had already left the laundry.

Therefore, the only place where Jackson could have seen the tomato is in the blue_crate, where he moved it before leaving the laundry. Therefore, Jackson really thinks the tomato is in the L. blue_crate.
