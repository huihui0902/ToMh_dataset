This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Nathan think the tomato is? 
- We know that Nathan moved the tomato to the blue_container before leaving the laundry. Therefore, Nathan thinks the tomato is in the blue_container.

2. Where does Jackson think the tomato is? 
- We know that Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate after Sophia left the laundry. Therefore, Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_crate.

3. Where does Nathan think Jackson thinks the tomato is? 
- We don't have enough information to answer this question. Nathan left the laundry before Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate, so he doesn't know where Jackson put it. We can only assume that Nathan thinks Jackson still believes the tomato is in the blue_container.

4. Where does Amelia think Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is? 
- We don't have any information about Amelia's thoughts on the tomato's location. However, we know that Amelia moved the onion to the green_cupboard in the hall. This means that she was in the same room as Jackson when he saw the mouse and lost his phone. Therefore, she may have overheard or witnessed something that could give her insight into Jackson's thoughts. 

5. Where does Sophia think Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is? 
- Sophia moved the tomato from the blue_container to the blue_cupboard before leaving the laundry. Therefore, she thinks the tomato is in the blue_cupboard. However, we don't have any information about her thoughts on Amelia's or Nathan's beliefs about the tomato's location. 

Based on the information given, we can't determine where Sophia thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
