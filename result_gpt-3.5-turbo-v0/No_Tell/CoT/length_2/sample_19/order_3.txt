This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Amelia think Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is?

2. We need to determine the location of the tomato according to each agent's movements and statements.

3. Sophia moved the tomato to the blue_cupboard, and Jackson moved it to the blue_crate.

4. Nathan moved the tomato back to the blue_container.

5. Therefore, Nathan must have known that the tomato was originally in the blue_cupboard, and Jackson moved it to the blue_crate.

6. Amelia made no movements in the laundry, so she does not have any direct knowledge of the tomato's location.

7. Charlotte also made no movements in the laundry, so she does not have any direct knowledge of the tomato's location.

8. Nathan, Jackson, and Amelia entered the hall, where the onion is located in the blue_treasure_chest.

9. Nathan made no movements in the hall, so he does not have any direct knowledge of the onion's location.

10. Jackson moved the onion to the red_envelope.

11. Amelia moved the onion to the green_cupboard.

12. Jackson saw a mouse and lost his phone, but these events are not relevant to the question.

13. Nathan, Jackson, and Amelia then entered the waiting_room.

14. Based on the movements and statements of the agents, we can conclude that Nathan knows the tomato was originally in the blue_cupboard, and Jackson moved it to the blue_crate.

15. Amelia does not have any direct knowledge of the tomato's location, but she knows that Nathan knows it was in the blue_cupboard and Jackson moved it to the blue_crate.

16. We need to determine where Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is.

17. Since Nathan knows the tomato was originally in the blue_cupboard and Jackson moved it to the blue_crate, he must think the tomato is in the blue_crate.

18. Amelia knows that Nathan knows the tomato was originally in the blue_cupboard and Jackson moved it to the blue_crate, so she must think that Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_crate.

19. Therefore, the answer is L. blue_crate.

So, the answer is L. blue_crate.
