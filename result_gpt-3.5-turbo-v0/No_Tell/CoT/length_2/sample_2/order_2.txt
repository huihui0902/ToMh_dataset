To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Amelia and the corn. According to the story, Amelia moved the corn to the red_basket before exiting the hallway. Lily entered the hallway after Amelia had left, so she did not witness Amelia moving the corn. However, Lily did witness Liam moving the melon to the red_basket before he exited the hallway. Therefore, Lily may assume that Amelia also put the corn in the red_basket since Liam put the melon there. 

The answer is B. red_basket.
