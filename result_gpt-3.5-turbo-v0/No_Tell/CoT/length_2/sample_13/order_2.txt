To answer this question, we need to track Avery's movements and statements, as well as Carter's movements. Avery entered the workshop with Sophia, Carter, Emily, and Isla. Avery made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute before exiting. Sophia moved the watermelon to the green_envelope, and Carter moved the watermelon to the green_basket before exiting. Avery dislikes the tomato, but there is no mention of Avery's thoughts on the watermelon's location.

Next, Avery, Sophia, Carter, Emily, and Isla entered the waiting_room. Carter likes the green_treasure_chest, but again, there is no mention of Avery's thoughts on the watermelon's location.

Then, Emily, Isla, and Avery entered the sunroom. The carrot is in the blue_treasure_chest. Emily moved the carrot to the green_box, and Isla moved the carrot to the green_crate before exiting. Avery made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute before exiting. Again, there is no mention of Avery's thoughts on the watermelon's location.

Based on the given information, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is. Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given.
