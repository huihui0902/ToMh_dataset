To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their statements. According to the story, Avery made no movements in the workshop and dislikes the tomato. Sophia moved the watermelon to the green_envelope and then exited the workshop. Carter moved the watermelon to the green_basket and then exited the workshop. Therefore, the watermelon could be in either the green_envelope or the green_basket. However, we need to consider the exit order as well. Carter exited the workshop after Sophia, so we can trust his statement more than Sophia's. Therefore, the watermelon is most likely in the green_basket. The answer is D. green_basket.
