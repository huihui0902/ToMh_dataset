To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the watermelon and Carter's movements. According to the story, the watermelon was initially in the blue_suitcase, then Sophia moved it to the green_envelope, and finally, Carter moved it to the green_basket. Carter exited the workshop after moving the watermelon to the green_basket. Since Carter exited the workshop after Avery, he tends to trust Avery's claim that he dislikes the tomato. Therefore, we can assume that Carter did not move the watermelon to the red_envelope, blue_bucket, green_cupboard, blue_treasure_chest, green_crate, red_drawer, green_drawer, green_treasure_chest, green_bathtub, red_bottle, or blue_pantry. The only option left is the green_basket, which is where Carter really thinks the watermelon is. Therefore, the answer is D. green_basket.
