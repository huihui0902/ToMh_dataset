To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the corn and the agents. According to the story, the corn was initially in the red_basket (step 2), then Hannah moved it to the green_bathtub (step 3), and Avery moved it back to the red_basket (step 13). Later, Abigail entered the basement with Hannah and William (step 17), and moved the corn to the green_bucket (step 21). Abigail then exited the basement (step 22), followed by William (step 24) and Hannah (step 25). 

Based on the assumption that agents tend to lie, we cannot trust what Abigail says about the location of the corn. However, we can infer her actual thought based on her movements and interactions with other agents. Since Abigail was in the basement with Hannah and William when the corn was moved to the green_bucket, and she exited the basement before them, she would tend to trust their claim that the corn was in the green_bucket. Therefore, the answer is E. green_bucket.
