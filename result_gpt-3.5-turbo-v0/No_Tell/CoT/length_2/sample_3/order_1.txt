To answer this question, we need to track Benjamin's movements and any interactions he had with other agents regarding the location of the peas. According to the story, Benjamin made no movements after entering the workshop and stayed there for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, he did not interact with any of the agents who moved the peas. We also do not have any information about Benjamin's private thoughts or conversations with other agents. Therefore, we cannot determine where Benjamin really thinks the peas is. The answer is unknown.
