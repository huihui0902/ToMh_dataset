First, we need to determine where Liam thinks the peas is. Liam moved the peas from the green_drawer to the blue_container and dislikes the peas. Therefore, Liam thinks the peas is in the blue_container.

Next, we need to determine where Noah thinks the peas is. Noah moved the peas from the blue_container to the green_crate. However, we don't know if Noah saw Liam move the peas to the blue_container or if he thought the peas was originally in the green_drawer. Therefore, we cannot determine where Noah thinks the peas is.

Now, we need to determine where Benjamin thinks the peas is. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute. Therefore, we don't have any information about where Benjamin thinks the peas is.

Finally, we need to determine where Avery thinks Liam thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is. We know that Avery moved the peas from the blue_container to the blue_bucket. However, we don't know if Avery saw Liam move the peas to the blue_container or if he thought the peas was originally in the green_drawer. Therefore, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Liam thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is.

Since we cannot determine the answer, the correct option is D. blue_cupboard.
