To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Owen and Noah with respect to the carrot. According to the story, Owen moved the carrot to the green_drawer and Noah moved it to the red_basket. We also know that Owen likes the red_basket and dislikes the spinach. However, we don't have any information about what Noah likes or dislikes. 

Based on the assumptions given, we can infer that Owen trusts Noah more than Mila because Noah exited the sunroom after Owen did. Therefore, Owen is more likely to believe Noah's claim about the location of the carrot. 

Since Noah moved the carrot to the red_basket and we don't have any conflicting information, we can assume that Owen thinks Noah thinks the carrot is in the red_basket. Therefore, the answer is A. red_basket.
