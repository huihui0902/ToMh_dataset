To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and their interactions with the cucumber. According to the story, the cucumber was initially in the green_treasure_chest when all five agents entered the dining_room. Ava made no movements and left after a minute, while Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red_envelope and left. Charlotte then moved the cucumber to the red_crate and left. William made no movements and left after a minute, and finally, Jacob moved the cucumber back to the green_treasure_chest before all five agents left for the waiting_room. Therefore, the correct answer is G. green_treasure_chest.
