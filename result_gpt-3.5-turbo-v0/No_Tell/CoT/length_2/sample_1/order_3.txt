To solve this question, we need to track the movements of Ava, Evelyn, and Charlotte regarding the cucumber. According to the story, Ava did not move the cucumber, and she left the dining room before anyone else moved it. Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red envelope, and Charlotte moved it to the red crate. Therefore, Charlotte knows that the cucumber is not in the green treasure chest where it originally was, and it is not in the red envelope where Evelyn moved it. Charlotte also knows that William did not move the cucumber, and Jacob moved it back to the green treasure chest after Charlotte moved it to the red crate. However, we do not have any information about what Ava thinks about the cucumber's location.

Now, we need to determine where Charlotte thinks Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the cucumber is. Since Charlotte knows that the cucumber is not in the green treasure chest or the red envelope, she can eliminate options D, G, and F. Charlotte also knows that Jacob moved the cucumber to the green treasure chest after she moved it to the red crate, so she can eliminate option I. The watermelon is not relevant to this question, so we can eliminate all options related to it (J, K, M, and N). 

Therefore, the possible options are A, C, E, H, and O. Since we do not have any information about what Ava thinks about the cucumber's location, we cannot eliminate any of these options based on Ava's thoughts. However, we know that Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red crate, and she trusts Jacob more than Evelyn because Jacob exited the pantry after Evelyn. Therefore, Charlotte might think that Evelyn thinks the cucumber is in the green cupboard (option C) because Jacob moved the cucumber to the green treasure chest after Charlotte moved it to the red crate. 

Therefore, the answer is C. Green cupboard.
