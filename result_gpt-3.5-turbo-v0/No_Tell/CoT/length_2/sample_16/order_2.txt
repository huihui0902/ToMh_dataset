To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the tangerine and the agents' exits from the den and the bathroom. Liam moved the tangerine to the blue_treasure_chest and then exited the den. Jackson moved the tangerine to the green_bathtub and then exited the den. Carter made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute before exiting. Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red_bucket and then exited the den. Sophia moved the tangerine back to the green_bottle before exiting the den. Benjamin, Liam, and Carter then entered the bathroom, where Benjamin moved the plum to the green_crate and Liam moved it to the red_drawer before they all exited. Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, Liam would trust Benjamin's movements more than Jackson's or Sophia's. Therefore, Liam would think that Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the red_bucket, as that was the last place Benjamin moved it before exiting the den. The answer is K. red_bucket.
