To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the tangerine and the thoughts of each character. 

- Liam moved the tangerine to the blue_treasure_chest.
- Jackson moved the tangerine to the green_bathtub and dislikes the tangerine.
- Carter made no movements and stayed in the den for 1 minute, then exited.
- Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red_bucket.
- Sophia moved the tangerine to the green_bottle and dislikes the banana.
- Liam exited the den.
- Benjamin moved the plum to the green_crate.
- Liam moved the plum to the red_drawer.
- Jackson dislikes the tangerine.
- Carter made no movements and stayed in the bathroom for 1 minute, then exited.
- Benjamin lost his phone.

Based on the assumptions, we know that Jackson can only infer Carter's thoughts if they have been in the same place or had private/public interactions. We also know that agents tend to lie, so what they tell others doesn't necessarily reflect their actual thoughts. 

Since Jackson dislikes the tangerine, we can eliminate any options where the tangerine is located. We also know that Carter made no movements with the tangerine, so his thoughts about its location are unknown. 

Liam moved the plum to the red_drawer, so we can eliminate any options where the plum is located. 

Benjamin lost his phone, so we can eliminate any options where the plum or tangerine are located since he would have been preoccupied with finding his phone instead of moving fruit. 

Therefore, the only option left is where the tangerine was last moved by Sophia, which is the green_bottle. 

So, Jackson thinks Carter thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the green_bottle. The answer is L. green_bottle.
