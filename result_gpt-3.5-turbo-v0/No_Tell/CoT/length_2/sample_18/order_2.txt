To answer this question, we need to track Lily and Noah's movements and thoughts regarding the corn. According to the story, Lily made no movements in the staircase and stayed there for 1 minute. Noah dislikes the green pepper but there is no mention of his thoughts on the corn. However, we know that Sophia moved the corn to the blue container. Lily then entered the front yard with Isla and Sophia, and moved the tomato to the green drawer. Finally, Lily and the others entered the waiting room.

Based on Lily's movements and the assumption that she tends to lie, we cannot trust her claims about where she thinks Noah thinks the corn is. However, we can infer that Noah might think the corn is in the blue container since that is where Sophia moved it. Therefore, the answer is M. blue_container.
