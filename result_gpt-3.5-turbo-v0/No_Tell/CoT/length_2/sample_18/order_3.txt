This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Isla think Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is?

2. Isla and Lily were both in the front yard where the tomato is located, but there is no mention of them discussing the corn or Noah's thoughts.

3. Noah dislikes the green pepper, but there is no mention of him having any thoughts about the corn.

4. Sophia moved the corn to the blue container, but there is no mention of her discussing it with anyone else.

5. Lily moved the tomato to the green drawer, but there is no mention of her discussing the corn or Noah's thoughts.

6. Isla made no movements in the staircase or waiting room, so there is no information about her thoughts on the corn or Noah's thoughts.

7. Based on the story and assumptions, we can infer that Isla and Lily did not have any private or public interactions where they discussed the corn or Noah's thoughts.

8. Therefore, we cannot determine where Isla thinks Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is.

9. The answer is none of the above (N/A).

In summary, this question requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions, and the answer cannot be determined based on the given information.
