To answer this question, we need to follow the movements of the agents and determine where the cherry ended up. Emily moved the cherry to the red_container, and then exited the pantry. Lily made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute before exiting. Emma then moved the cherry to the green_envelope before exiting the pantry. Avery then moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase before exiting the pantry. Finally, Ella made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute before exiting. 

Based on this information, we know that the cherry was last seen in the blue_suitcase, as that is where Avery placed it before exiting the pantry. Therefore, the answer is H. blue_suitcase.
