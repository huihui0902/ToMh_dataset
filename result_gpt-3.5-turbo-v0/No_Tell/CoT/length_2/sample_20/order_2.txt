To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the peas and the agents. Emily moved the peas from the blue suitcase to the red basket, then exited the bathroom. Ella moved the peas from the red basket to the red envelope, then exited the bathroom. Avery moved the peas from the red envelope to the blue cupboard, then exited the bathroom. Nathan moved the peas from the blue cupboard to the blue suitcase, then exited the bathroom. 

Since Emily exited the bathroom before Nathan moved the peas to the blue suitcase, she would not know where Nathan moved the peas. However, we can infer where Nathan thinks the peas is based on his movements. Nathan moved the peas from the blue cupboard to the blue suitcase, so he must think the peas is in the blue cupboard before he moved it. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is A. blue_suitcase.
