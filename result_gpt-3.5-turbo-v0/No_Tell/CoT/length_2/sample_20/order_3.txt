To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and their interactions. First, Emily moved the peas from the blue suitcase to the red basket. Then, Ella moved the peas from the red basket to the red envelope. Avery then moved the peas from the red envelope to the blue cupboard. Nathan moved the peas from the blue cupboard back to the blue suitcase. 

Since Ella moved the peas after Emily, she knows that Emily thinks the peas are in the red basket. However, Nathan moved the peas back to the blue suitcase after Emily moved them to the red basket. Therefore, Ella thinks that Nathan thinks the peas are in the blue suitcase. 

The answer is A. blue_suitcase.
