To answer this question, we need to track Nathan's movements and infer his thoughts based on the given assumptions. Nathan moved the peas to the blue suitcase after everyone else had exited the bathroom. Later, he entered the waiting room with the group and then went to the kitchen with Avery and Evelyn. While in the kitchen, he made no movements and stayed there for a minute before exiting. Based on the assumption that an agent tends to trust another agent who exited the room later than himself, we can assume that Nathan trusts Avery and Evelyn's claims about the location of the peas. 

From the story, we know that Emily moved the peas from the blue suitcase to the red basket, and Ella moved it from the red basket to the red envelope. Avery then moved it to the blue cupboard before Nathan moved it back to the blue suitcase. Therefore, Nathan knows that the peas is not in the blue cupboard or the red basket. 

There is no information about the green envelope, green basket, red crate, blue container, blue bucket, green bottle, blue treasure chest, red bucket, green box, or blue bathtub, so we can eliminate those options. The only option left is the red box, which is mentioned in the story as the location of the corn. 

Therefore, Nathan really thinks that the peas is in the red box. The answer is F. red_box.
