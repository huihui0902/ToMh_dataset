This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Where does Emily think the lime is?
- We know that Lily moved the lime from the red_bottle to the blue_drawer, so Emily should think the lime is in the blue_drawer.

2. Where does Lily think Emily thinks the lime is?
- Lily was in the attic with Emily, but she didn't make any movements or statements about the lime. Therefore, we can't infer what Lily thinks Emily thinks about the lime.

3. Where does Owen think the lime is?
- Owen was in the front_yard and didn't make any movements or statements about the lime. Therefore, we can't infer what Owen thinks about the lime.

4. Where does Emily think Owen thinks the lime is?
- Emily didn't have any interactions with Owen, so we can't infer what she thinks he thinks about the lime.

5. Where does Ella think Lily thinks Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is?
- Ella was in the front_yard with Lily, but Lily didn't make any movements or statements about the lime while they were there. However, Lily did move the lime to the blue_drawer before leaving the front_yard. Therefore, Ella should think that Lily thinks Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer.

Answer: C. blue_drawer
