To solve this question, we need to track Owen's movements and any interactions he had with other agents regarding the lime. According to the story, Owen made no movements in the front yard and exited after one minute. Therefore, he did not interact with any other agents regarding the lime in the front yard. In the waiting room, Owen entered with Lily, Emily, Ella, and Evelyn, but there is no mention of any interactions regarding the lime. However, we know that Owen likes the blue drawer, which is where Lily moved the lime to. Therefore, based on the given assumptions, we can infer that Owen trusts Lily's claim and thinks that the lime is in the blue drawer. Therefore, the answer is C. blue_drawer.
