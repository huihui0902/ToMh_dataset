To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions with each other. 

- Lily moved the lime from the red_bottle to the blue_drawer before exiting the front_yard. 
- Ella liked the red_bottle but made no movements before exiting the front_yard. 
- Owen made no movements before exiting the front_yard. 
- Evelyn moved the lime to the green_pantry before exiting the front_yard. 
- Emily made no movements before exiting the front_yard. 

Therefore, Emily did not witness the movement of the lime and does not know where it is. However, we can use the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves. 

Owen exited the front_yard after Emily, so she may trust his thoughts on the location of the lime. According to the story, Owen likes the blue_drawer, but Lily moved the lime from the red_bottle to the blue_drawer before exiting the front_yard. Therefore, Owen may think that the lime is in the blue_drawer. 

The answer is C. blue_drawer.
