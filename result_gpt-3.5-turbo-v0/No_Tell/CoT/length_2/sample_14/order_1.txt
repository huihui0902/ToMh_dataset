To answer this question, we need to trace Isla's movements and the movements of the lemon. Isla entered the hall with Evelyn, Alexander, Emma, and Sophia. The lemon was initially in the red_box. Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container before exiting the hall. Isla made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute before exiting. Alexander then moved the lemon to the green_treasure_chest before exiting the hall. Emma then moved the lemon to the green_bottle before exiting the hall. Sophia made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute before exiting. Isla did not move the lemon, so it should still be in the last place it was moved to, which is the green_bottle. Therefore, the answer is K. green_bottle.
