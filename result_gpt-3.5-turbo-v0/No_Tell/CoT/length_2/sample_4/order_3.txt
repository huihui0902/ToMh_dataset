Later, Evelyn, Mila, and Jacob entered the closet and moved the watermelon to the blue_suitcase and then to the red_drawer before exiting. Based on these movements, we can infer that Evelyn and Chloe did not have any private or public interactions regarding the location of the potato. Therefore, Evelyn has no information about where Chloe thinks the potato is. We cannot answer this question with the given information. The answer is none of the options provided.
