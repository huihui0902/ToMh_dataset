To determine where the cabbage really is, we need to follow the movements of the agents and any statements they make. 

1. Isla, Elizabeth, William, Aiden, and Abigail entered the playroom.
2. The cabbage is in the blue_bathtub.
8. William moved the cabbage to the blue_treasure_chest.
10. Aiden moved the cabbage to the blue_bottle.
28. The cabbage is in the blue_bottle.
31. Isla moved the cabbage to the blue_bathtub.

Based on these movements, we can see that the cabbage was initially in the blue bathtub, then moved to the blue treasure chest by William, then to the blue bottle by Aiden, and finally back to the blue bathtub by Isla. Therefore, the cabbage is really in the blue bathtub. 

The answer is F. blue_bathtub.
