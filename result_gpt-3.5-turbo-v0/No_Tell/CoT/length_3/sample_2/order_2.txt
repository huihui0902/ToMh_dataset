To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the onion and the agents' exits from the attic. According to the story, Emily was the first to enter the attic and made no movements before exiting. Charlotte moved the onion from the blue_treasure_chest to the green_treasure_chest before exiting. Owen then moved the onion to the red_drawer before exiting. Nathan made no movements before exiting, and Liam made no movements before exiting. 

Later, Emily moved the lemon from the red_bottle to the blue_container before exiting the front yard. Charlotte then moved the lemon to the blue_crate before exiting the front yard, and Liam moved the lemon to the green_drawer before exiting the front yard. 

After some time, Charlotte, Owen, Liam, and Nathan entered the attic together. Charlotte made no movements before exiting, and Owen moved the onion to the blue_bottle before exiting. Liam made no movements before exiting, and Nathan made no movements before exiting. 

Based on the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves, we can assume that Emily trusts Nathan more than Charlotte or Owen. Since Emily did not move the onion and Nathan made no movements in the attic, Emily would likely think that Nathan still believes the onion is in the last place it was moved to, which is the red_drawer. Therefore, the answer is N. red_drawer.
