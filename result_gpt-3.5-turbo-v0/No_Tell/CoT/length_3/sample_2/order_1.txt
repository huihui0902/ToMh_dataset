To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the onion and the agents' thoughts. According to the story, Emily, Charlotte, Owen, Nathan, and Liam entered the attic together. The onion was initially in the blue_treasure_chest, but it was later moved to the green_treasure_chest by Charlotte, and then to the red_drawer by Owen. Nathan made no movements while in the attic, but he lost his gloves there. 

Later, Charlotte, Owen, Liam, and Nathan entered the attic together again. The onion was in the red_drawer, but Owen moved it to the blue_bottle before they all exited the attic. 

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Nathan's actual thought may not match what he tells others, and that he may trust the thoughts of agents who exited the room later than him. 

Since Nathan made no movements with the onion while in the attic, we can assume that he did not know where the onion was moved to. However, since Owen moved the onion to the blue_bottle after Nathan left the attic, Nathan may trust Owen's thought that the onion is in the blue_bottle. Therefore, the answer is O. blue_bottle.
