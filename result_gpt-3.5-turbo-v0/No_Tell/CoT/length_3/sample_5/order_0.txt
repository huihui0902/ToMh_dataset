To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each agent and their interactions with the peas. According to the story, the peas were initially in the green_basket when all five agents entered the patio. Mila and Amelia made no movements and exited the patio after one minute each. Jackson also made no movements and exited the patio after one minute, but we know that he likes the green_bathtub, not the green_basket where the peas were located. Hannah moved the peas to the blue_bathtub before exiting the patio. Abigail made no movements and exited the patio after one minute. 

Therefore, based on the story, the peas are in the blue_bathtub. The answer is O. blue_bathtub.
