To solve this question, we need to trace the movements of Jackson, Amelia, and Hannah and their interactions. 

- Jackson entered the patio and made no movements before exiting. 
- Amelia entered the patio and made no movements before exiting. 
- Hannah entered the patio and moved the peas to the blue_bathtub before exiting. 
- Jackson likes the green_bathtub. 
- Hannah, Amelia, and Mila entered the lounge and moved the lemon to different places before exiting. 
- Mila moved the lemon to the green_box. 
- Hannah likes the green_crate. 
- Jackson entered the closet and made no movements before exiting. 
- Hannah, Abigail, Mila, and Jackson entered the waiting_room. 

Based on these movements, we can infer that Jackson and Amelia did not have any interactions or were not in the same place at the same time. Therefore, Jackson cannot infer what Amelia thinks about the location of the peas. 

Hannah moved the peas to the blue_bathtub, but we don't know what she thinks about the location of the peas. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is not determinable based on the given information.
