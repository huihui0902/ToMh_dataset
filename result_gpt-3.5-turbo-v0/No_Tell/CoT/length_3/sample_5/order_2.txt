To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Amelia and Hannah and the location of the peas. According to the story, Hannah moved the peas to the blue_bathtub, and then later moved the lemon to the red_envelope. Amelia was in the patio and then entered the lounge with Hannah and Mila. She then moved the lemon to the blue_container before exiting the lounge. 

There is no information in the story about Amelia and Hannah having any private or public interactions, so we cannot infer Amelia's thoughts about where Hannah thinks the peas is based on their conversations. However, we do know that Amelia exited the lounge before Hannah moved the lemon to the red_envelope, so Hannah would not have been able to tell Amelia where she moved the peas to. 

Therefore, the answer to the question is not provided in the story and cannot be determined.
