Step 1: Look for any information related to Noah's movements or actions regarding the pear.

Step 2: Trace the movements of the pear and see if Noah was present in any of those places.

Step 3: Use the assumption that agents tend to lie and that their claims don't reflect their actual thoughts.

Step 4: Use the assumption that agents tend to trust those who exited the room later than themselves.

Based on the story and assumptions, we can see that Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase and then exited the playroom. Later, William moved the pear to the green_crate and then exited the playroom. Finally, Aiden moved the pear to the blue_crate and then exited the playroom. Noah was not present in any of these movements, so we cannot trust his claims about the pear's location. However, we do know that William exited the playroom after Noah, so if Noah were to trust anyone, it would be William. Therefore, we can conclude that Noah really thinks the pear is in the green_crate, which is where William moved it. The answer is B. green_drawer.
