To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the pear and the agents who interacted with it. According to the story, the pear was initially in the blue_crate (statement 2). Jack moved the pear to the blue_drawer (statement 6), then William moved it to the green_crate (statement 9), and finally Aiden moved it back to the blue_crate (statement 14). Therefore, the pear is in the blue_crate (option L). The correct answer is L.
