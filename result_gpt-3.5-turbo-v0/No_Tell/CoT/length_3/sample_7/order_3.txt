To answer this question, we need to track Chloe's movements and interactions with Logan and Evelyn regarding the location of the watermelon. 

1. Chloe entered the staircase with Evelyn, Charlotte, Logan, and Mila.
2. Chloe lost his gloves.
3. The watermelon is in the green_cupboard.
4. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
5. Chloe lost his watch.
6. Evelyn exited the staircase.
7. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
8. Chloe exited the staircase.
9. Charlotte made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
10. Charlotte exited the staircase.
11. Logan made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
12. Logan exited the staircase.
13. Mila moved the watermelon to the green_cupboard.
14. Mila exited the staircase.
15. Evelyn, Chloe, Charlotte, Logan, and Mila entered the waiting_room.
16. Charlotte, Logan, and Chloe entered the staircase.
17. The lemon is in the red_pantry.
18. Charlotte made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
19. Charlotte exited the staircase.
20. Logan made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
21. Logan exited the staircase.
22. Chloe moved the lemon to the green_cupboard.
23. Chloe exited the staircase.
24. Charlotte, Logan, and Chloe entered the waiting_room.
25. Evelyn, Mila, Logan, and Chloe entered the staircase.
26. The watermelon is in the green_cupboard.
27. Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
28. Evelyn exited the staircase.
29. Mila made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
30. Mila exited the staircase.
31. Logan moved the watermelon to the red_bottle.
32. Logan exited the staircase.
33. Chloe made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute.
34. Chloe exited the staircase.
35. Evelyn, Mila, Logan, and Chloe entered the waiting_room.

Based on the story and assumptions, Chloe can only infer Logan's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private or public interactions. 

The only time Chloe and Logan were in the same place and had interactions regarding the location of the watermelon was when they were in the staircase together for the second time (steps 16-23). 

During this time, Chloe moved the lemon to the green_cupboard (step 22), and Logan moved the watermelon to the red_bottle (step 31). Therefore, Chloe knows that Logan thinks the watermelon is in the red_bottle. 

However, the question asks where Chloe thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the watermelon is. There is no information in the story that suggests Logan and Evelyn had any interactions or were in the same place regarding the location of the watermelon. Therefore, Chloe cannot infer Logan's thoughts about where Evelyn thinks the watermelon is.
