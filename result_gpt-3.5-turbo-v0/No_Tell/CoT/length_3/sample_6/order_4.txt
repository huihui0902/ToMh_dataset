This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Logan exited the study before the turnip was moved to the green_pantry by Elizabeth.
2. Logan lost his watch before entering the waiting_room with Hannah and Noah.
3. Noah moved the sweet_potato to the red_envelope before Logan moved it to the green_drawer.
4. Logan exited the dining_room before Hannah entered it and moved the turnip to the blue_pantry.
5. Noah and Lily were in the study together, but there is no information about their thoughts on the turnip.
6. Hannah was the last one to touch the turnip and moved it to the blue_pantry.

Based on these steps, we can infer that Logan thinks Noah thinks Lily thinks Hannah thinks the turnip is in the blue_pantry. Therefore, the answer is C. blue_pantry.
