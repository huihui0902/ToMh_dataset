To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Hannah and the turnip. According to the story, Hannah entered the study, made no movements, and stayed there for 1 minute before exiting. Later, Hannah entered the study again with Noah, Lily, and Elizabeth. While they were in the study, Hannah moved the turnip to the blue_pantry before exiting. 

Since Lily was in the study with Hannah when she moved the turnip, Lily knows that the turnip is not in the red_basket (where it was originally) but in the blue_pantry. Therefore, Lily thinks that Hannah thinks the turnip is in the blue_pantry. 

The answer is C. blue_pantry.
