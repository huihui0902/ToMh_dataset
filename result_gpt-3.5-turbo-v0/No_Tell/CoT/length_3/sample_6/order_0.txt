To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the turnip throughout the story. According to the story, the turnip was initially in the red_basket when Hannah, Lily, Logan, Elizabeth, and Noah entered the study. Elizabeth then moved the turnip to the green_pantry, and Noah later moved it to the red_basket again. Hannah then moved the turnip to the blue_pantry before they all left the study. Therefore, the turnip is actually in the blue_pantry. The answer is C.
