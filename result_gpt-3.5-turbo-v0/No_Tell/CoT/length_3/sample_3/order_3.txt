To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of the characters and their interactions. Mila moved the peas from the green_treasure_chest to the blue_bucket, and then Amelia moved the peas from the blue_bucket to the blue_cupboard. Carter moved the watermelon from the blue_bucket to the green_bucket. Isla made no movements related to the peas. Emma made no movements related to the peas. 

Since Amelia moved the peas to the blue_cupboard, it is likely that she thinks the peas are in the blue_cupboard. However, we need to determine what Carter thinks Amelia thinks Isla thinks. 

Carter and Amelia were both in the study together, but there is no indication that they had any private or public interactions related to the peas. Therefore, Carter cannot infer what Amelia thinks about the location of the peas based on their time in the study together. 

The only other time that Carter and Amelia were in the same room together was when they entered the waiting_room with Mila, Isla, and Emma. However, there is no indication that they had any private or public interactions related to the peas during this time. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Carter thinks Amelia thinks Isla thinks the peas is. The answer is unknown.
