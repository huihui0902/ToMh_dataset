To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Abigail and Avery with respect to the cucumber. Abigail moved the cucumber to the blue_container in step 3 and then exited the basement in step 4. Avery made no movements with respect to the cucumber and stayed in the basement for 1 minute in step 13 before exiting in step 14.
