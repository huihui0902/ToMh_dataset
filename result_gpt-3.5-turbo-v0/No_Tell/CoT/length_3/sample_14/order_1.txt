To solve this question, we need to track Avery's movements and any interactions he had with other agents regarding the cucumber. According to the story, Avery made no movements after Hannah exited the basement with the cucumber in the blue_bathtub. Therefore, Avery did not move the cucumber to any other location. We also do not have any information about Avery having any private or public interactions regarding the cucumber. 

Based on these assumptions, we can conclude that Avery really thinks the cucumber is still in the blue_bathtub. Therefore, the answer is K. blue_bathtub.
