To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and the location of the cucumber. According to the story, Abigail moved the cucumber to the blue_container, and then Hannah moved it to the blue_bathtub. Owen later moved the carrot to the red_pantry, but there is no mention of him moving the cucumber. Therefore, the cucumber is still in the blue_bathtub. The answer is K. blue_bathtub.
