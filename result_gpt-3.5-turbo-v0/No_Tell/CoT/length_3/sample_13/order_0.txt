To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the corn and the statements made by the agents. According to the story, the corn was initially in the green_bathtub (step 2). William moved the corn to the green_cupboard (step 3), and then Emily moved it to the red_envelope (step 7). Isla then moved the corn to the green_bottle (step 11), and finally, Jackson moved it back to the green_bathtub (step 13). 

Therefore, the correct answer is K. green_bathtub.
