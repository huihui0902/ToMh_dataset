To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of William, Emily, and Emma in relation to the corn. 

1. William, Emily, Emma, Isla, and Jackson entered the pantry.
2. The corn is in the green_bathtub.
3. William moved the corn to the green_cupboard.
4. Emma likes the blue_crate.
6. William dislikes the corn.
7. Emily moved the corn to the red_envelope.
10. Emma exited the pantry.
11. Isla moved the corn to the green_bottle.
13. Jackson moved the corn to the green_bathtub.
15. William, Emily, Emma, Isla, and Jackson entered the waiting_room.
26. William, Isla, Emily, and Emma entered the pantry.
27. The corn is in the green_bathtub.
30. Isla moved the corn to the green_cupboard.
32. Emily moved the corn to the blue_crate.
35. Emma moved the corn to the green_bottle.
37. William, Isla, Emily, and Emma entered the waiting_room.

Based on these movements, we know that William initially moved the corn from the green_bathtub to the green_cupboard, and then later made no movements when he re-entered the pantry. Emily moved the corn from the green_cupboard to the red_envelope, and then later moved it to the blue_crate. Emma made no movements with the corn in the first pantry visit, and then moved it to the green_bottle in the second pantry visit. 

Since Emma never witnessed William's dislike of the corn, she may assume that he still thinks the corn is in the green_bathtub. However, we need to determine where she thinks Emily thinks William thinks the corn is. 

We know that Emily moved the corn from the green_cupboard to the red_envelope, and then to the blue_crate. Since Emma likes the blue_crate, she may assume that Emily thinks William thinks the corn is in the blue_crate. Therefore, the answer is option D. blue_container.
