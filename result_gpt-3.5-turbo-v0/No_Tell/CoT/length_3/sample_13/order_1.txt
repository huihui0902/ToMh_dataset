To answer this question, we need to track William's movements and the movements of the corn. According to the story, William initially moved the corn from the green_bathtub to the green_cupboard. Later, Isla moved the corn from the green_cupboard to the green_bottle, and then Jackson moved the corn back to the green_bathtub. When William, Isla, Emily, and Emma entered the pantry again, the corn was back in the green_bathtub. William made no movements and stayed in the pantry for one minute before leaving. 

Based on this information, we can eliminate options A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, J, and L because William never moved the corn to any of those locations. We can also eliminate option O because Emma, not William, likes the blue_crate. 

That leaves us with options H and N. Isla moved the corn to the green_cupboard before William entered the pantry, so it's possible that William thinks the corn is still in the green_cupboard. However, when William and the others entered the pantry again, the corn was in the green_bathtub. Since William made no movements and stayed in the pantry for one minute before leaving, it's possible that he saw the corn in the green_bathtub and thinks that's where it is. 

Therefore, the answer is N. William really thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.
