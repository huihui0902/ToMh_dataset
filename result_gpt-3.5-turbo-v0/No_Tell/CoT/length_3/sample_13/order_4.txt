This is a complex question that requires breaking down the thought process of each agent involved. 

Starting with Jackson, he moved the corn to the green bathtub and then exited the pantry. He did not witness any of the subsequent movements of the corn. 

Next, Isla moved the corn to the green bottle before exiting the pantry. 

Then, Emily moved the corn to the blue crate and saw a mouse before exiting the pantry. 

Finally, Emma moved the corn to the green bottle before exiting the pantry. 

William did not move the corn during this sequence, but he did move the asparagus from the green bucket to the green drawer while in the crawlspace. 

Based on these movements, Jackson would think that Emma thinks the corn is in the green bottle, since that is where she last moved it. However, he cannot infer what Emily or William think about the corn's location since he did not witness their movements. 

Therefore, the answer is N. green bottle.
