To answer this question, we need to track Owen and Jack's movements and where the beans were moved to. According to the story, Owen and Jack both entered the hall together with the beans in the blue suitcase. Jack then moved the beans to the green treasure chest before exiting the hall. Owen made no movements in the hall and exited after Jack. 

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Owen can only infer Jack's thoughts if they had private or public interactions. However, there is no mention of any interactions between Owen and Jack regarding the location of the beans. Therefore, we cannot determine where Owen thinks Jack thinks the beans are.

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
