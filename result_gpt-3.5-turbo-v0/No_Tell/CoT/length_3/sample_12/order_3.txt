To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of Owen, Jack, and Liam and their interactions with each other. 

According to the story, Owen and Liam both entered the hall and made no movements before exiting. Jack then moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest before exiting. 

There is no mention of Liam interacting with Owen or Jack in the hall, so we cannot infer what Liam thinks about their thoughts on the location of the beans. 

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the story and the correct answer is not listed among the options.
