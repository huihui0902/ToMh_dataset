To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the lettuce and the agents who moved it. According to the story, the lettuce was initially in the blue_container in the back yard. Nathan moved it to the green_cupboard before exiting the back yard. Logan then moved it to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting the back yard. Abigail then moved it to the red_basket before exiting the back yard. Finally, Isabella moved it back to the blue_container before exiting the back yard. Therefore, the lettuce is in the blue_container, which is option K. The correct answer is K.
