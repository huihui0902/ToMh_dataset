To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the lemon and the agents. According to the story, Jack moved the lemon from the green_drawer to the blue_pantry, Liam moved it from the blue_pantry to the blue_crate, Aiden moved it from the blue_crate to the green_basket, and Nathan moved it from the green_basket to the green_drawer. Sophia did not move the lemon. 

We also need to consider the assumptions given, particularly the fact that agents tend to lie and that their public claims may not reflect their actual thoughts. 

Based on the story and the assumptions, we cannot be sure where Aiden really thinks the lemon is. Aiden may have claimed to move the lemon to the green_basket, but this may not reflect his actual belief. It is possible that Aiden thinks the lemon is in a different location, but we cannot determine which location based on the given information. 

Therefore, the answer is not provided in the options given and the correct answer is "Cannot be determined."
