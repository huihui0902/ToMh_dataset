To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the lemon and the agents' interactions. Here are the steps to solve the question:

1. Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer (step 11).
2. Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket (step 7).
3. Nathan exited the garage (step 12).
4. Aiden exited the cellar (step 31).

Based on assumption (2), Nathan can only infer Aiden's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions. From the story, we know that Nathan and Aiden have never been in the same place together, so we need to look for any private or public interactions between them.

From the story, we know that Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket before Nathan exited the garage. Therefore, Nathan could have seen Aiden moving the lemon to the green_basket before he left the garage. However, we don't know if Nathan actually saw Aiden doing this or if he was paying attention to something else.

Based on assumption (4), Nathan tends to trust an agent that exited the room later than himself. Since Nathan exited the garage before Aiden exited the cellar, he may not fully trust Aiden's movements with the lemon.

Therefore, we cannot be certain where Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is. The answer is inconclusive.
