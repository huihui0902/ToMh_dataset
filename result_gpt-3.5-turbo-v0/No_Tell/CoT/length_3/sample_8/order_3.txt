To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the lemon and the agents' thoughts about its location. 

First, Jack moved the lemon from the green_drawer to the blue_pantry. Then, Liam moved it from the blue_pantry to the blue_crate. Aiden then moved it from the blue_crate to the green_basket. Finally, Nathan moved it from the green_basket to the green_drawer. 

We need to determine where Jack thinks Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is. Since Jack exited the garage before Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer, he does not know its current location. However, he knows that he likes the green_drawer, so he may assume that Nathan thinks Aiden put the lemon in the green_drawer. 

Therefore, the answer is L. green_drawer.
