To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Aiden and Jacob regarding the sweet_potato. Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket, and then he exited the master_bedroom. Jacob did not move the sweet_potato and exited the master_bedroom after Aiden. Therefore, according to assumption (4), Aiden tends to trust Jacob's thoughts more than his own. Since Jacob did not move the sweet_potato, Aiden would think that Jacob still believes the sweet_potato is in the original location, which is the green_bottle. Therefore, the answer is B. green_bottle.
