To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the sweet_potato and the agents. According to the story, the sweet_potato was initially in the green_bottle when Jacob, Mila, Elizabeth, Aiden, and Amelia entered the master_bedroom. Aiden then moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket before exiting the master_bedroom. However, Amelia later moved the sweet_potato back to the green_bottle before leaving the master_bedroom. Therefore, the sweet_potato is really in the (B) green_bottle.
