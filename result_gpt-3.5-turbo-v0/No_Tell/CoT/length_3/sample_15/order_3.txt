To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Aiden, Jacob, and Mila regarding the sweet_potato. Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket, and then he exited the master_bedroom. Jacob made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Mila also made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, Mila knows that Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket, but she doesn't know where Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is. So, Mila cannot think about where Aiden thinks Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is not given in the story.
