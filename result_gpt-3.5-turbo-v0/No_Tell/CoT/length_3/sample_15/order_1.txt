To answer this question, we need to track Jacob's movements and the movements of the sweet_potato. Jacob entered the master_bedroom with the sweet_potato in the green_bottle. He made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute before exiting. Aiden then moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket, and later Amelia moved it back to the green_bottle before they all entered the waiting_room. Jacob did not have any private or public interactions with Aiden or Amelia regarding the sweet_potato. Therefore, we cannot infer Jacob's actual thought about the sweet_potato's location. The answer is unknown.
