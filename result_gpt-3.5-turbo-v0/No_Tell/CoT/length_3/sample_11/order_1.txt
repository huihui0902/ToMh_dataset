To answer this question, we need to track William's movements and the movements of the melon. William entered the porch with the group, made no movements, and then exited. Therefore, he did not move the melon to the blue_pantry or the green_bucket. The melon was eventually moved to the green_bathtub by Isla. William then entered the waiting_room with the group and later exited to the front_yard. Isla moved the beans to the green_bottle in the front_yard, but there is no mention of the melon being moved again. Therefore, based on the story and assumptions, William really thinks the melon is in the green_bathtub. The answer is A. green_bathtub.
