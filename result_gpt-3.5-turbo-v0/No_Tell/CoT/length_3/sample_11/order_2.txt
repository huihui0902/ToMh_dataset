To answer this question, we need to track the movements of William and Lily and their interactions with the melon. William entered the porch and made no movements, so he did not interact with the melon. Lily also made no movements in the porch, so she did not interact with the melon either. Aiden moved the melon to the blue_pantry, so Lily could have seen this happen. However, we do not know if Lily trusts Aiden's movements or not. Therefore, we cannot determine where Lily thinks William thinks the melon is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the options given.
