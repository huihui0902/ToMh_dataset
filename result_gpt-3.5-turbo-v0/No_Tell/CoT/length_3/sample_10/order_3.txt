To answer this question, we need to track the movements of each character and their interactions. Here are the steps to solve the question:

1. Charlotte moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer.
2. William moved the sweet_potato to the red_container.
3. Logan, Ava, Evelyn, Charlotte, and William entered the waiting_room.
4. Ava, Logan, and Evelyn entered the hallway.
5. Evelyn moved the peas to the green_bathtub.
6. William, Logan, Evelyn, and Charlotte entered the bedroom.
7. William moved the banana to the green_bottle.
8. Logan moved the banana to the green_envelope.
9. Evelyn moved the banana to the red_crate.
10. Charlotte moved the banana to the green_pantry.
11. William, Logan, Evelyn, and Charlotte entered the waiting_room.

Based on the assumption that an agent can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or have had private or public interactions, we can conclude that Charlotte has no way of knowing where Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is. 

None of the movements or interactions mentioned in the story involve Logan, Evelyn, or the sweet_potato after Charlotte moved it to the green_drawer and William moved it to the red_container. Therefore, Charlotte cannot infer Logan's thoughts on where Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is. 

The answer is none of the above options.
