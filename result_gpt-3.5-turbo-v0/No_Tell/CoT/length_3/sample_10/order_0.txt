To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the sweet_potato throughout the story. Initially, the sweet_potato is in the red_container in the kitchen. Ava moves it to the blue_cupboard before leaving the kitchen. Charlotte then moves it to the green_drawer before leaving the kitchen. Finally, William moves it back to the red_container before leaving the kitchen. Therefore, the sweet_potato is really in the red_container, which is option F. The other options are all places where the sweet_potato was temporarily moved to but not where it currently is.
