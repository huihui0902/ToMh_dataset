To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of each character and their interactions. Here are the steps to follow:

1. William moved the sweet_potato to the red_container.
2. Charlotte moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer.
3. Logan did not move the sweet_potato.
4. Ava moved the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard.
5. Evelyn did not move the sweet_potato.

Based on these movements, we can see that the sweet_potato was moved to different locations by different characters. However, we need to determine where William thinks Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is.

Since William and Charlotte were both in the kitchen when the sweet_potato was first introduced, they could have interacted and shared their thoughts. However, Logan did not move the sweet_potato, so he may not have had a strong opinion on its location.

Evelyn moved the peas to the green_bathtub in the hallway, but this does not give us any information about her thoughts on the sweet_potato.

Therefore, we need to focus on Charlotte's movements and her potential interactions with William. Charlotte moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer, which means she may have thought it was a good location for it. William may have observed this and inferred that Charlotte thinks the sweet_potato should be in the green_drawer.

However, we still need to determine what Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks about the sweet_potato. Since Logan did not move the sweet_potato, he may not have had a strong opinion on its location. Therefore, Charlotte's thoughts on Logan's thoughts may not be relevant.

Evelyn moved the peas to the green_bathtub, but this does not give us any information about her thoughts on the sweet_potato.

Therefore, we can conclude that William thinks Charlotte thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_drawer, but we cannot determine what Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks about the sweet_potato. The answer is J. green_drawer.
