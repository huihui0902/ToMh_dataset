To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the sweet_potato and the agents who interacted with it. The sweet_potato was initially in the red_container when all five agents entered the kitchen. Ava moved it to the blue_cupboard before leaving the kitchen. Charlotte then moved it to the green_drawer before leaving the kitchen. Finally, William moved it back to the red_container before leaving the kitchen. 

Evelyn was the only agent who did not interact with the sweet_potato in the kitchen. She then entered the hallway with Ava and Logan, where they saw the peas in the red_basket. Evelyn moved the peas to the green_bathtub before leaving the hallway. 

Based on the assumptions given, we know that Evelyn can only infer the location of the sweet_potato based on her interactions with other agents or their public claims. Since she did not interact with the sweet_potato in the kitchen, she would have to rely on the claims of Ava, Charlotte, William, or Logan. 

However, we also know that every agent tends to lie, so their claims cannot be trusted. Therefore, we cannot determine where Evelyn really thinks the sweet_potato is based on the given information. The answer is unknown.
