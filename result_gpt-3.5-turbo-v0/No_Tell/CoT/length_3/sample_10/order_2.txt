To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Logan and Evelyn and their interactions with the sweet_potato. Logan entered the kitchen with Evelyn, Ava, Charlotte, and William. He made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute before exiting. Evelyn also made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute before exiting. 

Ava saw a mouse and moved the sweet_potato from the red_container to the blue_cupboard before exiting the kitchen. Charlotte then moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer before exiting the kitchen. Finally, William moved the sweet_potato back to the red_container before exiting the kitchen. 

Logan, Ava, and Evelyn then entered the hallway, where the peas were located in the red_basket. Ava made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute before exiting. Logan also made no movements and stayed in the hallway for 1 minute before exiting. Evelyn then moved the peas to the green_bathtub before exiting the hallway. 

Logan, William, Evelyn, and Charlotte then entered the bedroom, where the banana was located in the green_cupboard. William moved the banana to the green_bottle before exiting the bedroom. Logan then moved the banana to the green_envelope before exiting the bedroom. Evelyn then moved the banana to the red_crate before exiting the bedroom. Finally, Charlotte moved the banana to the green_pantry before exiting the bedroom. 

Based on these movements, we can determine that Logan and Evelyn were both in the kitchen when the sweet_potato was moved around. However, Logan made no movements and did not interact with the sweet_potato, so he would not have any information about its location beyond what he saw when he first entered the kitchen. 

Evelyn, on the other hand, stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute and may have seen the sweet_potato being moved around. However, we do not have any information about where she thinks the sweet_potato is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is. The answer is not provided in the given options.
