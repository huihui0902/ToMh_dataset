To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the persimmon and the agents' interactions. 

1. Hannah moved the persimmon from the red_basket to the blue_crate. 
2. Carter moved the persimmon from the blue_crate to the green_basket. 
3. William moved the persimmon from the green_basket to the red_basket. 

Hannah exited the bedroom before any other agent moved the persimmon. Therefore, she does not know about Carter and William's movements. 

In the waiting room, Hannah, Alexander, Carter, Avery, and William were present. However, William, Alexander, and Hannah went to the bathroom, leaving only Carter and Avery in the waiting room. 

When they returned from the bathroom, William, Alexander, Avery, and Hannah went to the garage. There, Alexander moved the plum from the red_drawer to the green_cupboard, Avery moved it to the blue_treasure_chest, William moved it to the green_bottle, and Hannah moved it to the blue_bathtub. 

Since Hannah was not present when William moved the persimmon to the red_basket, she does not know where he thinks the persimmon is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Hannah thinks William thinks the persimmon is. 

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
