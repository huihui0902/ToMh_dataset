To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the persimmon and the agents' interactions. 

1. Hannah, Alexander, Carter, Avery, and William entered the bedroom.
2. The persimmon is in the red_basket.
3. Hannah moved the persimmon to the blue_crate.
4. Hannah exited the bedroom.
5. Alexander made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
6. Alexander exited the bedroom.
7. Carter moved the persimmon to the green_basket.
8. Carter exited the bedroom.
9. Avery made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute.
10. Avery exited the bedroom.
11. William moved the persimmon to the red_basket.

Based on the assumption that agents tend to lie, we cannot trust what William says about the persimmon's location. However, we can infer his actual thought based on his movements and interactions with other agents. 

William was the last agent to exit the bedroom, so he may trust the movements of the agents who exited before him. Carter moved the persimmon to the green_basket, but William moved it back to the red_basket. This suggests that William thinks the persimmon is in the red_basket, even though he may claim otherwise. 

Therefore, the answer is A. red_crate.
