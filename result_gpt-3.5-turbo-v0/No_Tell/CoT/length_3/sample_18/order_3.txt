This is a complex question that requires careful analysis of the story and assumptions. Here are the steps to solve the question:

1. Identify the agents involved: Owen, Alexander, and Elizabeth.
2. Determine the order of their exits from the workshop: Elizabeth, Alexander, Nathan.
3. Focus on the movements of the lime and the plum, as they are the key items in the question.
4. Trace the movements of the lime: it starts in the blue_crate, is moved by Elizabeth to the green_pantry, then by Nathan to the green_basket, then by Owen to the red_box, and finally by Jackson back to the blue_crate.
5. Trace the movements of the plum: it starts in the green_box, is moved by Alexander to the red_drawer, then by Nathan to the green_cupboard.
6. Determine which locations Owen, Alexander, and Elizabeth have been in together, or have had private or public interactions.
7. Based on the assumptions, Owen can infer Alexander's thought about the location of the lime only if they have been in the same place, or have had private or public interactions.
8. From the story, we know that Owen and Alexander have been in the workshop together, and that Elizabeth has also been in the workshop, but has exited before Alexander.
9. Therefore, Owen can infer Alexander's thought about the location of the lime based on what he knows about Alexander's movements in the workshop.
10. Alexander moved the plum to the red_drawer, which is not the same location as the lime.
11. Therefore, Owen cannot infer Alexander's thought about the location of the lime based on his movements in the workshop.
12. The correct answer is therefore impossible to determine based on the given information.
