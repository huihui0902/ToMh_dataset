To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the lime and Elizabeth. According to the story, the lime was initially in the blue_crate, but Elizabeth moved it to the green_pantry. Therefore, Elizabeth knows that the lime is not in the blue_crate anymore. Later, Nathan moved the lime to the green_basket, and Owen moved it to the red_box. However, we don't have any information about Elizabeth's knowledge of these movements. 

Therefore, the only possible answer is N. green_pantry, as that is the last place Elizabeth knew the lime to be.
