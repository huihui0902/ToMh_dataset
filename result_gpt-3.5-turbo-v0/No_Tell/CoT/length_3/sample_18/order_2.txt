To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Elizabeth and the lime. According to the story, Elizabeth moved the lime from the blue_crate to the green_pantry before exiting the cellar. Later, Owen moved the lime to the red_box, and then Jackson moved it back to the blue_crate. Alexander then moved the plum to the red_drawer before exiting the workshop. 

Based on these movements, we can infer that Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry, since that was the last place Elizabeth was seen with the lime before it was moved by Owen and Jackson. Therefore, the answer is N. green_pantry.
