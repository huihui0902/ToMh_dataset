To solve this question, we need to track the movements of the lime and the agents who interacted with it. According to the story, the lime was initially in the blue_crate (statement 3). Elizabeth moved it to the green_pantry (statement 4), and then Nathan moved it to the green_basket (statement 9). Owen then moved it to the red_box (statement 11), and finally, Jackson moved it back to the blue_crate (statement 13). Therefore, the lime is really in the blue_crate (option L). The other options are not supported by the story.
