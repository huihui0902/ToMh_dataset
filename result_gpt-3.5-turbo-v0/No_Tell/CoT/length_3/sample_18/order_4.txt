To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of the lime and the agents' interactions. 

- The lime starts in the blue_crate (step 3).
- Elizabeth moves the lime to the green_pantry (step 4).
- Nathan moves the lime to the green_basket (step 9).
- Owen moves the lime to the red_box (step 11).
- Jackson moves the lime back to the blue_crate (step 13).

Based on the assumption that agents tend to lie, we cannot trust any agent's claim about where they think the lime is. However, we can use the exit order to infer who might have interacted with whom and potentially shared information.

- Elizabeth exits the cellar first (step 5).
- Alexander exits the cellar next (step 8).
- Nathan exits the cellar after moving the lime (step 10).
- Owen exits the cellar after moving the lime (step 12).
- Jackson exits the cellar last (step 14).

We know that Nathan moved the lime to the green_basket before exiting the cellar, so he knows that the lime is not in the blue_crate anymore. However, he has no information about where the lime is after he exits the cellar. 

Owen moved the lime to the red_box after Nathan, so he knows that the lime is not in the green_basket anymore. However, he has no information about where the lime is after he exits the cellar. 

Alexander did not move the lime, but he exited the cellar after Elizabeth and before Nathan and Owen. He might have overheard Elizabeth's conversation with Jackson about the lime's location, but we cannot be sure. 

Elizabeth moved the lime from the blue_crate to the green_pantry before exiting the cellar. She might have shared this information with Alexander, but we cannot be sure. 

Jackson lost his watch in the cellar and likes the blue_suitcase in the workshop, but he has no information about the lime's location. 

Based on this analysis, we cannot confidently determine where Nathan thinks Owen thinks Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is. The question is asking for a chain of thoughts that involves multiple agents and their assumptions, but we do not have enough information to trace this chain. The correct answer is therefore unknown and cannot be determined from the given story and assumptions.
