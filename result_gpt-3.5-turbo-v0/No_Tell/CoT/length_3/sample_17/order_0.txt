To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the eggplant throughout the story. According to the story, the eggplant was initially in the green_pantry (as stated in sentence 2). Emily then moved the eggplant to the blue_drawer (sentence 3), and later Emma moved it to the green_box (sentence 7). When Emily, Avery, Jack, and Emma re-entered the garage (sentence 23), the eggplant was in the green_box (sentence 15). Emily then moved the eggplant to the green_bottle (sentence 18), and Jack moved it to the green_pantry (sentence 20). Therefore, the correct answer is G. green_pantry.
