To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of Jack, Jackson, and Emma regarding the eggplant. 

- Jack entered the garage with Emily, Avery, Emma, and Jackson. 
- Jack made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute before exiting. 
- Jackson made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute before exiting. 
- Emma moved the eggplant to the green_box while Jack was still in the garage. 
- Later, Emma, Emily, and Jack entered the garage again. 
- The eggplant was in the green_box at this point. 
- Emma made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute before exiting. 
- Emily moved the eggplant to the green_bottle before exiting. 
- Jack moved the eggplant to the green_pantry before exiting. 

Based on these movements, we can conclude that Jack knows the eggplant was in the green_pantry when he left the garage for the second time. However, we don't have any information about where Jackson thinks the eggplant is. 

Since Jackson made no movements regarding the eggplant and didn't witness any of the movements made by Emma, Emily, or Jack, he has no way of knowing where the eggplant is. Therefore, we cannot determine where Jack thinks Jackson thinks Emma thinks the eggplant is. 

The answer is: Cannot be determined.
