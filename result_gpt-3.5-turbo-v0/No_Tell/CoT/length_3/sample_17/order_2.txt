To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Emma and the eggplant. According to the story, Emma moved the eggplant from the blue_drawer to the green_box, and then later moved it again to the green_bottle. Jackson was in the garage when Emma moved the eggplant to the green_box, but he made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute before exiting. Therefore, he did not witness Emma moving the eggplant to the green_bottle. 

Based on assumption (2), Jackson can only infer Emma's thought about the eggplant if they had been in the same place or had private or public interactions. According to the story, Jackson and Emma did not have any private interactions, and there is no mention of any public interactions between them. Therefore, Jackson cannot accurately infer where Emma thinks the eggplant is.

Since we cannot determine where Emma thinks the eggplant is, we cannot determine where Jackson thinks Emma thinks the eggplant is. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
