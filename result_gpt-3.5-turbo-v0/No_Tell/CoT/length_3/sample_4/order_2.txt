To answer this question, we need to track the movements of Benjamin and Emma and the location of the green pepper. According to the story, Jackson moved the green pepper from the red basket to the blue container while all five agents were in the living room. Benjamin then saw a cat and exited the living room, while Emma stayed in the living room for one minute before exiting. Later, Benjamin, Emma, and Abigail entered the bedroom where they found the grapes in the red bottle. Benjamin then moved the grapes to the green bathtub before exiting the bedroom. Emma stayed in the bedroom for one minute before exiting. 

There is no mention of Emma making any movements related to the green pepper, so we cannot determine where she thinks it is. However, we do know that Benjamin did not witness Jackson moving the green pepper to the blue container, so he may not know its current location. We also know that Benjamin moved the grapes to the green bathtub, which is not related to the location of the green pepper. 

Therefore, we cannot determine where Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is based on the given information. The answer is not provided in the multiple-choice options.
