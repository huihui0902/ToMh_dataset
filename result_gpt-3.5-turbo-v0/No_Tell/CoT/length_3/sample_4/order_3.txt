To answer this question, we need to trace the movements of Jackson, Benjamin, and Emma regarding the green pepper. Jackson initially moved the green pepper from the red basket to the blue container in the living room. Benjamin did not make any movements in the living room and only saw a cat. Emma also did not make any movements in the living room and only liked the blue bottle in the waiting room. 

Since Benjamin did not witness Jackson moving the green pepper, he cannot know its current location. However, Emma was in the living room when Jackson moved the green pepper to the blue container. Therefore, Emma knows that the green pepper is in the blue container. 

Now, we need to determine where Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is. Since Benjamin did not witness the movement of the green pepper, he cannot have any thoughts about its current location. However, Emma knows that the green pepper is in the blue container. Therefore, Jackson thinks that Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is in the blue container.

The answer is G. blue_container.
