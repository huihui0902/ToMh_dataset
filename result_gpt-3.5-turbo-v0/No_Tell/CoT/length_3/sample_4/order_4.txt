This is a complex question that requires careful analysis. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Abigail thinks: We need to consider what Abigail knows about the location of the green pepper. According to the story, Jackson moved the green pepper from the red basket to the blue container. Abigail was in the living room when this happened, so she knows that the green pepper is in the blue container.

2. Jackson thinks: We need to consider what Jackson knows about the location of the green pepper and what he might be thinking. Jackson moved the green pepper to the blue container, so he knows that it is there. However, we don't have any information about what he might be thinking about the green pepper.

3. Benjamin thinks: We need to consider what Benjamin knows about the location of the green pepper and what he might be thinking. Benjamin saw a cat in the living room, but we don't have any information about what he knows or thinks about the green pepper.

4. Emma thinks: We need to consider what Emma knows about the location of the green pepper and what she might be thinking. We know that Emma likes the blue bottle, but we don't have any information about what she knows or thinks about the green pepper.

5. Putting it all together: Abigail thinks that Jackson thinks that Benjamin thinks that Emma thinks the green pepper is in the blue container. This is because Abigail knows that the green pepper is in the blue container, and she trusts Jackson's movements because he exited the living room after her. Benjamin and Emma did not move the green pepper, so Abigail cannot infer their thoughts about its location. Therefore, the answer is G. blue_container.
