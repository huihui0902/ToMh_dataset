To answer this question, we need to track the movements of the agents and the location of the green pepper. According to the story, the green pepper was initially in the red basket (statement 2), but Jackson moved it to the blue container (statement 3). We don't have any further information about the green pepper's location after that. Therefore, the answer is G. blue_container.
