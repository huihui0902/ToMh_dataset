 Step-by-step analysis:

1. Jackson made no movements for 1 minute then exited the garage (line 11-12). So he didn't see where Emma moved the eggplant to the green_box (line 7).

2. Jack made no movements for 1 minute then exited the garage (line 9-10). So he also didn't see where Emma moved the eggplant.

3. Emma, Emily and Jack re-entered the garage together (line 14). At this point, Emma knows the eggplant is in the green_box (line 15) but Jack doesn't. 

4. Emma exits without moving the eggplant (line 16-17). 

5. Emily then moves the eggplant to the green_bottle (line 18-19). 

6. Jack moves the eggplant to the green_pantry (line 20-21).

7. Based on the assumptions:
   - Emma thinks the eggplant is in the green_box (where she left it)
   - Jack thinks the eggplant is in the green_pantry (where he put it)
   - Jackson has no information about the eggplant's location

8. Emily was the last to exit the garage (line 22). So based on Assumption 4, she will trust Jack the most about the eggplant's location.

Therefore, the answer is:
Emily thinks Jack thinks Jackson thinks Emma thinks the eggplant is in  G. green_pantry
