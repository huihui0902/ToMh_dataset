 Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Jack was in the garage when Emma last moved the eggplant (Lines 14-21).  

2) When Emma last exited the garage, the eggplant was in the green_box (Line 15).

3) Emma made no movements after her last movements with the eggplant (Line 16).

4) Based on Assumption 1, when Emma exited the garage, she witnessed the eggplant was still in the green_box.

5) Therefore, Emma thinks the eggplant is in the green_box when she last exited the garage (Line 17).

6) Jackson was not in the garage when Emma last moved the eggplant (Lines 1-12).  

7) Based on Assumption 2, Jackson cannot infer Emma's thoughts directly.

8) Jack exited the garage after Jackson (Lines 1-12).

9) Based on Assumption 4, Jackson would trust Jack's information over Emma's.

10) Therefore, Jackson thinks that Jack thinks the eggplant is in the green_box.

In summary, the answer is H: green_box.
