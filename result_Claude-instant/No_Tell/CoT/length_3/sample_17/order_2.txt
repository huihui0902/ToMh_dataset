 Step-by-step reasoning:

1) Jackson made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute when the eggplant was last seen in the green_box (line 7).

2) Since Jackson exited the garage last (line 12), according to assumption (4) he will trust everything he witnessed.

3) However, according to assumption (3), he cannot trust what the others said, only their actual movements.  

4) Since Jackson did not witness any movements by Emma after line 7 when the eggplant was in the green_box, the last location he saw the eggplant was in the green_box.

5) Therefore, Jackson will think that Emma thinks the eggplant is in the green_box.

The answer is H: green_box
