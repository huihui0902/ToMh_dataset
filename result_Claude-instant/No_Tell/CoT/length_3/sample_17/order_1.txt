 Okay, here are my steps in determining where Emma thinks the eggplant is:

1. Emma moved the eggplant to the green_box in step 7, so initially she would think it is in the green_box.

2. Emma stayed in the garage for 1 minute after moving the eggplant in step 16, but did not move the eggplant herself. 

3. After Emma exited the garage in step 17, Emily moved the eggplant to the green_bottle. However, Emma did not witness this since she had already exited.  

4. When Emma re-entered the garage in step 23, the cherry, not the eggplant, was mentioned to be in the blue_drawer.

5. None of the movements of the cherry would change Emma's belief that the eggplant is in the green_box, since those movements do not mention the eggplant.

Given these steps, Emma would still believe the eggplant is in the green_box, since that is the last place she remembers moving it to.

So the answer should be: H. green_box
