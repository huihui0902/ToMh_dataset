 Okay, here is my reasoning step by step:

1. According to statements 3, 7 and 20, we know the eggplant was last placed in the green_pantry by Jack before he exited the garage.

2. Since all agents witness all movements before exiting (assumption 1), the other agents would know the eggplant's last known location is the green_pantry. 

3. Note that the story does not mention any agent claiming the eggplant is somewhere else or moving it again.

4. Based on the above, the most reasonable conclusion is that the eggplant is still in its last known location, the green_pantry.

Therefore, the eggplant is most likely in the green_pantry, so the answer is G.

In summary:
- The eggplant was last seen in the green_pantry by Jack.  
- No agent claimed to move it from there or said it was somewhere else.
- Based on assumption 1, all agents would know it was last seen in the green_pantry.
- Hence, the most logical conclusion is that it remains in the green_pantry.
