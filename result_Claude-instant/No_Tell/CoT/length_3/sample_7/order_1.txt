 Okay, here are my thoughts going through the story step-by-step:

1) We are first introduced to the characters and location. Nothing relevant yet.

2) Chloe loses his gloves. Also irrelevant.  

3) The watermelon is stated to be in the green_cupboard initially.

4-12) Evelyn, Charlotte, Logan and Mila all stay in the staircase for 1 minute and then exit. They do not interact and do not witness any movements.

13) Mila moves the watermelon to the green_cupboard and exits. 

14) All characters enter the waiting_room.

15-23) Charlotte, Logan and Chloe enter and exit the staircase. Chloe moves the lemon to the green_cupboard. Evelyn and Mila are not involved.

24) All characters enter the waiting_room again.

25-34) Evelyn, Mila, Logan and Chloe enter and exit the staircase. Logan moves the watermelon to the red_bottle. Evelyn, Mila and Chloe do not witness this movement.

35) All characters enter the waiting_room.

Given that Evelyn does not witness any movements related to the watermelon and has no interactions with the other characters regarding its location, she has no reason to think it is anywhere other than the initial location of the green_cupboard, based on the storyline and assumptions provided.

So my final answer would be: L. green_cupboard

Does that sound reasonable? Let me know if you need any clarification on my thought process.
