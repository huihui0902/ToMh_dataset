 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. Logan and Evelyn were both in the staircase together in lines 25-34 when the watermelon's location was mentioned.

2. The story says that agents can infer another agent's thoughts if they were in the same place. So Logan could infer Evelyn's thoughts about the watermelon's location.

3. The watermelon's location was stated as the "green_cupboard" in line 26.

4. Nothing in the story indicates that Evelyn moved the watermelon or said anything to indicate she thought it was somewhere else. 

5. Therefore, Logan would think Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the "green_cupboard" based on what he witnessed.

So the answer is L: green_cupboard

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
