 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis to solve the question:

1) Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the green_cupboard. This is based on statement 13 where Mila moved the watermelon to the green_cupboard while Evelyn was present in the staircase.

2) Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the green_cupboard. Logan witnessed Evelyn's exit from the staircase after Mila moved the watermelon to the green_cupboard. 

3) Chloe thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the green_cupboard. Chloe witnessed Logan's exit from the staircase after Logan had witnessed Evelyn's exit.

4) Charlotte thinks Chloe thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the watermelon is in the green_cupboard. Charlotte witnessed Chloe's exit from the staircase after Chloe had witnessed Logan's exit.

Therefore, the answer is L: green_cupboard
