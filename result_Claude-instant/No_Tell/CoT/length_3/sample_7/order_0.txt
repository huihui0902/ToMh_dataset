 Based on the story and assumptions, here are my thoughts:

- At the beginning, the watermelon is in the green_cupboard (stated in line 3).
- Up to line 14, nobody has moved the watermelon. 
- From line 15 onwards, several people enter and exit the staircase, but nobody mentions moving the watermelon.
- In line 31, Logan moves the watermelon to the red_bottle.

Since nobody else is stated to have moved the watermelon after that, the most reasonable conclusion is that the watermelon is in the red_bottle, so the answer should be M. red_bottle.
