 Okay, here is my step-by-step thought process to solve this problem:

1) Alexander, Avery, Hannah and William were all in the bedroom together when the persimmon was initially placed in the red_basket. So they all know the initial location of the persimmon.

2) Hannah moved the persimmon to the blue_crate and exited the bedroom. Alexander saw this movement.

3) Carter then moved the persimmon to the green_basket. Alexander did not see this since he had already exited.

4) Avery and William also did not make any movements while in the bedroom. 

5) When they all entered the waiting room, nobody had new information about the persimmon's location, so they all still thought it was in the blue_crate.

6) In the bathroom, William moved the banana but nobody moved the persimmon. So when they exited the bathroom, nobody's thoughts about the persimmon changed.

7) When they entered the garage, nobody had new information about the persimmon.

8) Hannah moved the plum, not the persimmon, in the garage. So nobody's thoughts about the persimmon changed.

In summary, throughout the entire story, nobody gained any new information about the persimmon's location except that Hannah initially moved it to the blue_crate. So:

Alexander thinks Avery thinks Hannah thinks William thinks the persimmon is in the blue_crate (Option G)

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
