 Here are my step by step thoughts to solve this problem:

1. Jackson and Evelyn were in the dining room together on lines 16-24. However, they did not make any movements related to the spinach or have any interactions, so they did not gain information about each other's thoughts on the spinach.

2. Jackson and Evelyn were in the living room together on lines 26-38, but again did not make any spinach-related movements or have interactions.

3. Evelyn made no movements related to the spinach before exiting the living room on line 35. This means Jackson gained no information about Evelyn's thoughts on the spinach from Evelyn's actions.

4. Evelyn expressed liking the green pantry on line 37 after exiting the living room, but this was a private thought that Jackson could not hear.

5. Therefore, Jackson gained no information about where Evelyn thinks the spinach is from any of Evelyn's actions or claims.

6. The last place Jackson knew the spinach was located was when he moved it to the green cupboard on line 30 before exiting the living room.

In summary, Jackson has no information to suggest Evelyn thinks the spinach is anywhere other than the last place Jackson knew it to be, which was the green cupboard.

So the answer is O: green_cupboard
