 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my reasoning:

1. The spinach was originally in the green_drawer (line 2).

2. Noah moved the spinach to the green_drawer after everyone else had exited (line 12). Since he witnessed everything before exiting, we can assume he last accurately knew the spinach's location.

3. Jackson's claim that he moved the spinach to the green_cupboard (line 30) is likely a lie, since he exited before Noah.

4. Elizabeth's claim to have moved it to the blue_treasure_chest (line 33) is also likely a lie, for the same reason.

5. Evelyn witnessed everything before exiting last (line 35), but did not make any claim about the spinach's location, so we cannot trust his thoughts on the matter.

Therefore, based on the story events and assumptions, the spinach is most likely still in the green_drawer, after Noah moved it there in line 12.

The answer is L: green_drawer
