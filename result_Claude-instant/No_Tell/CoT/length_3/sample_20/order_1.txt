 Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1. Evelyn was last in the living_room in steps 7 to 9. At that time, according to step 7, Evelyn moved the spinach to the red_container.

2. Based on Assumption 1, Evelyn witnesses everything before exiting a place. So in steps 7 to 9, Evelyn knows the spinach is in the red_container. 

3. After that, Evelyn was not back in the living_room. So he did not witness any further movements of the spinach.

4. Therefore, based on the information Evelyn has, he would still think the spinach is in the red_container, where he last moved it in step 7.

So the answer is N. red_container
