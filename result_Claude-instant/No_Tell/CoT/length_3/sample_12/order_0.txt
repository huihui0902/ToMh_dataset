 Based on the given story and assumptions, here is my thought process to determine where the beans is really located:

1. Benjamin moved the beans to the blue_suitcase according to line 11.
2. Owen witnessed Benjamin moving the beans since they were both in the hall together at that time based on assumption 1.  
3. However, Owen tends to lie according to assumption 3, so we cannot trust what he claims.
4. Jack, Jackson and Liam made no movements and exited the hall before Benjamin moved the beans, so they did not witness it based on assumption 1. 
5. Therefore, only Owen knows for sure that the beans is in the blue_suitcase.
6. But since Owen tends to lie, we cannot trust his potential claims about the location of the beans.
7. We also cannot infer any agent's thoughts based on their exit order from a room, according to assumption 4.

In summary, the only reliable information we have is that Benjamin moved the beans to the blue_suitcase according to line 11. Since we cannot trust what any of the agents claim and cannot infer their knowledge based on exit order, we must assume the beans is really in the blue_suitcase based on Benjamin's movements.

So the answer is A: blue_suitcase
