 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where Owen thinks Jack thinks the beans is:

1) Owen and Jack were both in the hall together in statements 1-4 and 23-34. 

2) In statement 2, Owen saw that the beans was in the blue_suitcase.

3) In statement 7, Jack moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest. Owen saw this since he was still in the hall.

4) Owen exited the hall before Jack in statement 4.

5) Owen and Jack were then in the workshop together in statements 14-21, but the location of the beans was not mentioned for the workshop.

6) Owen and Jack returned to the hall together in statement 23. 

7) In statement 24, Owen again saw that the beans was in the blue_suitcase.

8) Owen again exited the hall before Jack in statements 27 and 28.

9) Based on assumptions 1, 2 and 4, Owen believes that Jack last saw the beans in the green_treasure_chest since Owen witnessed Jack moving the beans there. Even though Owen later saw the beans back in the blue_suitcase, he exited the hall before Jack and thus assumes Jack still thinks the beans is where he last moved it.

Therefore, the answer is E: green_treasure_chest
