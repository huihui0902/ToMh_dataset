 Okay, here are the steps to solve the question:

1. Owen thinks the beans is in the blue_suitcase. This is because the beans was last seen in the blue_suitcase while Owen was in the hall. 

2. Jack thinks the beans is in the green_treasure_chest. This is because Jack moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest while in the hall.

3. Liam was only with Owen in the hall initially. He has no information about where Jack moved the beans.

4. Based on assumption 4, Liam trusts Owen more than Jack since Owen exited the hall earlier.

Therefore, Liam thinks Owen thinks Jack thinks the beans is in the blue_suitcase.

The answer is A: blue_suitcase
