 Here are my step by step thoughts:

1. The story says the beans were initially in the blue_suitcase (line 2).

2. Then Jack moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest (line 7) before exiting the hall. 

3. According to assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. So Jack would have seen the beans in the green_treasure_chest before he exited.

4. There were no further movements with the beans after Jack exited.

5. Therefore, Jack would think the beans are in the green_treasure_chest, based on what he witnessed before exiting.

So the answer is:

E. green_treasure_chest
