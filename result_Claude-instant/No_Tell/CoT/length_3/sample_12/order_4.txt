 Step by step reasoning:
1. Owen exited the hall before Jack in step 4 and step 8. So according to assumption 4, Owen will tend to trust Jack's claim.

2. Jack claimed in step 7 that he moved the beans to the green_treasure_chest. 

3. So Owen would think that Jack thinks the beans is in the green_treasure_chest.

4. Benjamin was not present when Owen and Jack were in the hall. According to assumption 2, he can only infer others' thoughts if he was in the same place.

5. Therefore, Benjamin thinks Liam thinks Owen thinks Jack thinks the beans is in green_treasure_chest.

The answer is E. green_treasure_chest
