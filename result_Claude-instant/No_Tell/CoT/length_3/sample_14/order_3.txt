 Step by step analysis:
1. Abigail, Hannah and Avery were only in the basement together at the beginning. According to assumption 2, this means Abigail and Hannah can infer each other's thoughts, but Avery's thoughts are unknown to them.

2. The story says the cucumber was initially in the blue_drawer. Abigail moved it to the blue_container. 

3. Avery made no movements and stayed in the basement for 1 minute, so according to assumption 1, he witnessed nothing.

4. After that, Abigail, Hannah and Avery did not interact again.

5. Therefore, Hannah would think Abigail last saw the cucumber in the blue_container. 

6. But Hannah does not know what Abigail thinks Avery thinks, since Avery made no movements and Abigail and Avery did not interact after that.

Conclusion: Hannah would think Abigail thinks Avery thinks the cucumber is in O. blue_container

The answer is O: blue_container
