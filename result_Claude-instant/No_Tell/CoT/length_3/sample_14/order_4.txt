 Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1) Avery never saw the cucumber after it was moved by Owen. So Avery has no information about where the cucumber is.

2) Hannah never saw Avery after Avery exited the basement and they never interacted privately. So Hannah has no information about where Avery thinks the cucumber is. 

3) Owen never saw Hannah after she exited the basement and they never interacted privately. So Owen has no information about where Hannah thinks Avery thinks the cucumber is.

4) Therefore, the answer is Owen thinks Hannah thinks Abigail thinks Avery thinks the cucumber is: green_box (B)
