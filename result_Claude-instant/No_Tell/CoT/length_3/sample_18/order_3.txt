 Step by step reasoning:
1. Owen was in the cellar with Elizabeth, Alexander and the others initially but then exited. He never went back to the cellar.

2. When Owen was in the cellar, Elizabeth moved the lime to the green_pantry (Statement 4). 

3. Based on Assumption 1, when Owen exited the cellar, he witnessed Elizabeth move the lime to the green_pantry.

4. After Owen exited the cellar, Nathan, then Alexander moved the lime to different locations. But Owen was not witness to these movements as he already exited.

5. In the workshop, Owen moved the plum and then exited. He did not interact with or witness Elizabeth or Alexander's actions regarding the lime.

6. Based on Assumptions 2 and 4, Owen would trust Elizabeth more than Alexander as Elizabeth exited the cellar before Alexander.

7. Therefore, Owen would think that Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry, based on what Elizabeth did when Owen was still in the cellar.

The answer is: G. blue_pantry
