 Okay, here is my step by step thought process to solve this question:

1. According to lines 4 and 9, Elizabeth moved the lime to the green_pantry and then Nathan moved it to the green_basket. 

2. Owen then moved the lime to the red_box according to line 11. 

3. Then Jackson moved it to the blue_crate according to line 13.

4. Based on Assumption 1, an agent witnesses all movements before exiting. So when Nathan exited the cellar in line 10, he last saw the lime in the green_basket.

5. Then when Alexander exited the cellar in line 8, he last saw the lime in the red_box, moved by Owen.

6. When Elizabeth exited the cellar in line 5, she last saw the lime in the green_pantry, where she moved it.

7. Based on Assumption 4, agents tend to trust those who exited later. So Nathan will think Alexander thinks Elizabeth last saw the lime in the green_pantry.

8. Therefore, the answer is G: green_pantry

In summary, by following the story in order and applying the given assumptions step by step, we can determine that Nathan thinks Owen thinks Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry.
