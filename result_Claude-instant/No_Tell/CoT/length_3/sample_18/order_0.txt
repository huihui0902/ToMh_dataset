 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my logical reasoning for where the lime is really located:

1) From the story, we know the last person to move the lime was Jackson in step 13, where he moved it to the blue_crate.
2) Since Elizabeth exited the cellar first in step 5,  she did not witness Jackson moving the lime to the blue_crate in step 13.  
3) Nathan, Owen and Alexander also exited the cellar before Jackson in steps 9, 11 and 12. So they also did not witness Jackson moving the lime.
4) According to Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. Since Jackson was the last to exit the cellar, no one witnessed him move the lime to the blue_crate.
5) Assumption 3 states that each agent tends to lie, so we cannot trust what anyone claims. We must rely solely on facts in the story and assumptions.
6) Putting this all together, based on the information provided, the lime is most likely really located in the blue_crate, as that is the last place it was moved in the story, according to step 13.

Therefore, the answer is L: blue_crate
