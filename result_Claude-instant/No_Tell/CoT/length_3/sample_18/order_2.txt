 Okay, here are the steps I took to solve this puzzle:

1. Alexander and Elizabeth were only in the cellar and waiting room together. They did not interact privately or publicly.

2. When Elizabeth exited the cellar, she moved the lime to the green_pantry. Alexander witnessed this.

3. After Elizabeth exited, Nathan, Owen and Jackson entered the cellar and moved the lime to different locations. 

4. Alexander then exited the cellar. At this point, he last saw Elizabeth move the lime to the green_pantry.

5. Alexander and Elizabeth did not interact in the waiting room, so Alexander has no new information about where Elizabeth thinks the lime is.

6. Therefore, Alexander still thinks Elizabeth thinks the lime is in the green_pantry, the last location he saw her move it to.

So the answer is N: green_pantry
