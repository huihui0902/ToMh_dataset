 Here are the step by step deductions:

1) Elizabeth exited the cellar first after moving the lime to the green_pantry (line 4 and 5). So she has not witnessed the movements of Nathan, Alexander and Owen who moved the lime after her (lines 9, 11, and 13).

2) Elizabeth then entered and exited the workshop without interacting with the lime at all (lines 22 and 23). 

3) Therefore, Elizabeth's last known location of the lime was green_pantry when she exited the cellar according to the story.

Conclusion: Elizabeth really thinks the lime is in green_pantry (option N) based on the story and assumption.
