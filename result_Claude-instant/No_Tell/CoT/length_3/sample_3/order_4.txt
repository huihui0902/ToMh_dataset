 Okay, here is my step by step thought process to solve this problem:

1) Mila does not know where Carter thinks Amelia thinks Isla thinks the peas is because Mila left the staircase before Carter, Amelia and Isla. So Mila has no information on what happened after she left.

2) Carter knows that Isla made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute after he left. So Carter can infer that Isla thinks the peas is in the green_bucket where he put it.

3) Amelia knows that Isla made no movements and stayed in the staircase for 1 minute after she left. So Amelia can infer that Isla thinks the peas is in the green_bucket where Carter put it.

4) Isla actually knows the peas is in the green_bucket where Carter put it.

So from Mila's perspective, without knowing what happened after she left the staircase, the most likely place she would think Carter thinks Amelia thinks Isla thinks the peas is would be:

C. green_bucket
