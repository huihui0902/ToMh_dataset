 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. The peas is initially in the green_treasure_chest according to line 2.

2. Mila moves the peas to the blue_bucket according to line 3. So Mila should think the peas is in the blue_bucket. 

3. Carter moves the peas to the green_bucket according to line 5. So Carter should think the peas is in the green_bucket.

4. Isla makes no movements and stays in the staircase for 1 minute according to line 7. So she likely does not know where the peas is.

5. Amelia makes no movements related to the peas.

6. When Mila, Carter, Isla, Amelia and Emma enter the waiting_room in line 14, they have not had any private or public interactions. So they cannot infer each other's thoughts.

7. In lines 15-23, Amelia, Carter and Isla enter the staircase but make no movements related to the peas. 

8. When they enter the waiting_room again in line 24, again they have not had interactions so cannot infer each other's thoughts.

Given the information in the story and assumptions, we can conclude that Isla likely still does not know where the peas is. The answer is therefore: D. red_envelope
