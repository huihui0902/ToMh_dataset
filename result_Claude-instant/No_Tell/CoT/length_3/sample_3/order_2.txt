 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. The peas started in the green_treasure_chest according to line 2.

2. Mila moved the peas to the blue_bucket according to line 3. 

3. Mila exited the staircase before Carter according to line 4 and 6.

4. Carter then moved the peas to the green_bucket according to line 5.

5. Isla stayed in the staircase and did not witness Mila or Carter's movements according to line 7.

6. Isla exited the staircase after Carter according to line 8 and 6.

7. Amelia stayed in the staircase and did not witness any movements according to line 9, 10 and 11.

8. Emma stayed in the staircase but did not witness any movements according to line 12 and 13.

Based on these facts and the assumptions:

- Isla did not witness where the peas was moved to, since she stayed in the staircase the entire time (assumption 1).  
- Amelia did not witness any movements either (assumption 1).
- Emma also did not witness any movements (assumption 1).

Since Isla exited after Carter, Amelia would tend to trust Carter more than Isla according to assumption 4. 

The most likely answer would therefore be:

C. green_bucket, since that is where Carter last moved the peas according to line 5.
