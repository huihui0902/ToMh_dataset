 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. The story says the peas is in the green_treasure_chest initially in line 2.

2. Mila moved the peas to the blue_bucket in line 3, so after Mila's action, the peas is in the blue_bucket.

3. Carter then moved the peas to the green_bucket in line 5, so after Carter's action, the peas is in the green_bucket.

4. No one else moved or mentioned the peas, so the final location of the peas is the green_bucket. 

Therefore, the answer is C: green_bucket.
