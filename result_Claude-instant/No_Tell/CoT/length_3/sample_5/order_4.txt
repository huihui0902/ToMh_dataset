 Okay, here are the steps:
1. Hannah moved the peas to the blue_bathtub (line 10). So Hannah thinks the peas is in the blue_bathtub.

2. Amelia didn't witness Hannah moving the peas, since they were never in the same place. So Amelia doesn't know where Hannah thinks the peas is.

3. Abigail didn't witness anything related to the peas. So Abigail doesn't know where Amelia thinks Hannah thinks the peas is.

Therefore, the answer is O. blue_bathtub
