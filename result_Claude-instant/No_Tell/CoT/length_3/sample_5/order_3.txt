 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where Jackson thinks Amelia thinks Hannah thinks the peas is:

1. Jackson and Amelia were never in the same place, so Jackson has no way of inferring where Amelia thinks the peas is.

2. Amelia and Hannah were in the lounge together (lines 15-25). 

3. Hannah moved the peas from the green_basket to the blue_bathtub while Amelia was not around (lines 10-11).

4. Based on Assumption 2, Amelia would have witnessed Hannah moving the peas to the blue_bathtub.

5. Therefore, Amelia thinks Hannah thinks the peas is in the blue_bathtub.

6. Since Jackson has no way of inferring Amelia's thoughts, he also thinks Amelia thinks the peas is in the blue_bathtub.

So the answer is O: blue_bathtub

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any questions or would like me to clarify or expand on any part of my reasoning.
