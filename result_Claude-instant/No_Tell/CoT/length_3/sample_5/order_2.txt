 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis based on the story and assumptions:

1. We are not told that Amelia had any direct interactions or communications with Hannah.

2. The only place Amelia and Hannah were both present was in the lounge. 

3. When Hannah was in the lounge, she moved the lemon to the red_envelope, then the green_box. She did not mention or interact with the peas.

4. Based on Assumption 2, since Amelia and Hannah were not in the same place when Hannah moved the peas, Amelia would not be able to infer where Hannah thinks the peas is located.

5. Therefore, the answer is C) green_cupboard. Since Amelia had no information from which to deduce where Hannah thinks the peas is, she would have to guess randomly. C is just one of the random options provided.

In summary, based on the information in the story and assumptions, there is no evidence that Amelia could deduce where Hannah thinks the peas is located. Amelia would have to make a random guess from the options provided.
