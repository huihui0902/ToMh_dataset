 Okay, here are my steps to solve the question:

1. The story says "The peas is in the green_basket." in line 2, so the peas was initially in the green_basket.

2. None of the agents made any movements involving the peas before exiting the patio, according to lines 3-13. 

3. Therefore, when the agents entered the waiting_room in line 14, the peas was still in the green_basket.

4. Only Hannah entered the lounge where the peas was, according to line 15.

5. Hannah moved the peas to the blue_bathtub in line 10.

6. No other agents made movements involving the peas after that, according to lines 16-35.

7. Therefore, when all the agents entered the waiting_room in line 36, the peas was in the blue_bathtub.

So the answer is:

O. blue_bathtub
