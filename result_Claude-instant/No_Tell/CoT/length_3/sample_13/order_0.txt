 Okay, here is my step-by-step thought process:

1) The story starts with the corn in the green_bathtub (line 2).

2) William moves the corn to the green_cupboard (line 3). 

3) Emma then enters the pantry but makes no movements (line 9).

4) Isla then moves the corn to the green_bottle (line 11).  

5) Jackson then moves the corn back to the green_bathtub (line 13).

6) After everyone exits the pantry, no one else reenters the pantry until lines 26-37.

7) During the second time in the pantry, William makes no movements (line 28), Isla moves the corn to the green_cupboard (line 30), Emily moves the corn to the blue_crate (line 32), and Emma moves the corn to the green_bottle (line 35).

Based on this, and under the assumption that each agent's movements actually reflect the location of the corn, it appears the corn is most likely in:

N. green_cupboard

Does this sound correct? Let me know if you would like me to expand on my reasoning or clarify anything.
