 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. William, Emily, Emma, Isla and Jackson were all initially in the pantry together.

2. The corn was initially in the green_bathtub.

3. William moved the corn to the green_cupboard and then exited the pantry. 

4. Emily then moved the corn to the red_envelope and exited the pantry.

5. Emma then moved the corn to the green_bottle and exited the pantry. 

6. Jackson moved the corn back to the green_bathtub and exited the pantry.

7. Based on Assumption 1, each agent would have witnessed all the movements of corn before they exited.

8. William, Emily, Emma, Isla and Jackson then entered the waiting_room together.

9. William, Emily and Isla then entered the crawlspace. 

10. William moved the asparagus to the green_drawer and then exited.

11. Emily and Isla made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting.

12. William, Emily and Isla then returned to the waiting_room.

13. They re-entered the pantry.

14. William made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute before exiting.

15. Isla moved the corn to the green_cupboard and exited.  

16. Emily then moved the corn to the blue_crate and saw a mouse before exiting.

17. Emma moved the corn to the green_bottle and exited.

18. Based on the information given, it seems Emily would think William thinks the corn is currently in the green_cupboard (Option M).
