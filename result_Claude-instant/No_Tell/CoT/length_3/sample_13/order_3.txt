 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. Emma and Emily were both in the pantry when William was last there in lines 26-29. However, William made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute, so Emma and Emily did not witness where William actually moved the corn.

2. Even though Emma and Emily exited the pantry after William, based on Assumption 4, they may still distrust that William actually left the corn where he said he did.

3. Emma moved the corn to the green_bottle in line 35. However, this does not reveal where she actually thinks William moved the corn. 

4. Emily moved the corn to the blue_crate in line 32. However, like Emma, this does not reveal where she actually thinks William moved the corn.

5. Based on Assumption 2, Emma can only infer Emily's thoughts if they were in the same place. Since they were in the pantry together when William was last there, Emma may be able to infer Emily's thoughts on where William moved the corn.

6. Putting this all together, the answer that best fits is: 

Where does Emma think Emily thinks William thinks the corn is?
N. green_bottle

So the answer is N: green_bottle
