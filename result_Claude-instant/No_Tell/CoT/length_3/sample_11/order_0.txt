 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solve this problem:

1. The story says that initially the melon is in the green_bathtub (line 2).

2. William enters the porch first and exits after 1 minute without making any movements (lines 3-4). So he cannot tell others where the melon is.  

3. Lily enters the porch after William and exits after 1 minute without making any movements (lines 5-6). So she also cannot tell others where the melon is.

4. Aiden enters the porch after Lily and moves the melon to the blue_pantry before exiting (line 7).  

5. Emma enters the porch after Aiden and moves the melon to the green_bucket before exiting (line 10).

6. Isla enters the porch last and moves the melon to the green_bathtub before exiting (line 12).

7. Given Assumption 1 that an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place, Isla would know the melon ended up in the green_bathtub when she exited last.

8. No further movements or interactions involving the melon are mentioned.

Based on the above, the correct answer should be:

C. green_bucket 

This is because Emma moved the melon to the green_bucket (line 10) and nobody moved the melon from there after that, according to the story.
