 Okay, here are my steps to solve this problem:

1. William entered the porch where the melon was in the green_bathtub. He stayed for 1 minute and then exited.

2. After William exited, several other agents moved the melon to different places while William was not around.

3. William then entered the front_yard where beans were in the red_bottle. He stayed for 1 minute and then exited. 

4. While William was in the front yard, Isla moved the beans to the green_bottle. But William did not witness this.

5. Based on Assumption 2, since William was not in the same place as other agents when the melon and beans were moved, he cannot infer where they actually are based on the other agents' actions.

6. Based on Assumption 3, we cannot trust what any agent claims or tells others.

7. Therefore, the only information William has is that when he first entered the porch, the melon was in the green_bathtub. He has no information about where it was moved after that.

So based on this reasoning, the answer should be:

A. green_bathtub
