 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my analysis:

1) Lily and Hannah were both in the study while the turnip was in the red_basket (lines 2 and 25). 

2) Hannah exited the study before Lily (lines 4 and 6).

3) When Hannah exited, the turnip was still in the red_basket. She made no movements (line 3).

4) According to assumption 4, Lily would tend to trust Hannah more since Hannah exited earlier. 

5) After Hannah exited, Elizabeth moved the turnip to the green_pantry (line 10).

6) When Lily exited the study, the turnip was still in the green_pantry (line 31).

7) Therefore, Lily would think Hannah last saw the turnip in the red_basket, where it was when Hannah exited the study.

So the answer is A: red_basket
