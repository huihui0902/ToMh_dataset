 Okay, here is my step by step thinking:

1) Hannah was the last to exit the study in line 25-36. So she is the one Logan will most trust for the turnip location.

2) Lily exited the study before Hannah in line 30-31. So she will think Hannah knows the turnip location. 

3) Noah exited the study before Lily in line 28-29. So he will think Lily knows the turnip location.  

4) Logan was not in the study in line 25-36, so he does not actually know where the turnip is. He will think Noah thinks Lily thinks Hannah knows.

5) According to the story, Hannah moved the turnip to the blue_pantry in line 32.

Therefore, the answer is C: blue_pantry
