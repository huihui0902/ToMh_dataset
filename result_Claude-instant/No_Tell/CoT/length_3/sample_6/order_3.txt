 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Noah and Hannah witnessed Lily making no movements and staying in the study for 1 minute before they exited the study (lines 5-7).

2. Based on assumption 2, Noah can infer Lily's thoughts but Lily cannot infer Noah and Hannah's thoughts. 

3. When Lily exited the study, the turnip was in the red_basket (line 2). So Lily thinks the turnip is in the red_basket.

4. Hannah then moved the turnip to the blue_pantry before exiting the study (line 32). 

5. Based on assumption 4, Lily will tend to trust Hannah more since Hannah exited later than her.

6. So Noah will think that Lily thinks that Hannah thinks the turnip is in the blue_pantry.

Therefore, the answer is C: blue_pantry
