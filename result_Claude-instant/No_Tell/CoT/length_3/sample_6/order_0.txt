 Thank you for the story and assumptions. Based on the information provided, here is my logical reasoning:

1) According to statements 2 and 12, the last person to touch the turnip was Noah who moved it to the red_basket. 

2) According to assumption 1, all characters witness all movements before exiting a place. 

3) There are no statements indicating anyone else moving the turnip after Noah exited.

Therefore, based on the information given, the most likely answer is:

A. red_basket

The turnip is most likely still in the red_basket where Noah last placed it, unless a statement was missed indicating someone else moved it after Noah exited.
