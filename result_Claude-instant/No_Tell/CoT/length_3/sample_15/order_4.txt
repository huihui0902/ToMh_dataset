 Okay, here is my step by step thought process to solve this:

1. Jacob, Elizabeth and Mila stayed in the master_bedroom together for 1 minute, while Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket.

2. When Jacob exited, he did not witness Aiden moving the sweet_potato. So he thinks it is still in the green_bottle.

3. When Mila exited, she witnessed Aiden moving the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket. So she knows it is in the blue_bucket.

4. When Elizabeth exited, she also witnessed Aiden moving it to the blue_bucket. So she also knows it is in the blue_bucket.

5. Later, Mila and Elizabeth stayed in the crawlspace while Aiden and Jacob stayed in the office. They had no interaction, so they cannot infer each other's thoughts.

6. Based on the above, Elizabeth thinks Mila thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket. Since she directly witnessed it.

7. Elizabeth thinks Mila thinks Aiden thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle. Because when Aiden exited the master_bedroom, Jacob still thought it was in the green_bottle.

8. Elizabeth thinks Mila thinks Aiden thinks Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle.

Therefore, the answer is B: green_bottle
