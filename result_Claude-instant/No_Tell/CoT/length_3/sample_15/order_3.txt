 Okay, here is my step by step analysis of where Mila thinks Aiden thinks Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is:

1. According to the story, Jacob, Mila, Elizabeth, Aiden and Amelia all entered the master_bedroom together initially.

2. The story says that initially, the sweet_potato was in the green_bottle.

3. Jacob then exited the master_bedroom without any movements. 

4. Next, Mila exited the master_bedroom without any movements.

5. Then Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket before exiting the master_bedroom.

6. Finally, Amelia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle before exiting.

7. According to the assumptions, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place.

8. This means that when Mila exited the master_bedroom, she knew the sweet_potato was in the green_bottle.

9. When Aiden exited, he knew the sweet_potato had been moved to the blue_bucket.

10. When Jacob exited first, he did not witness any movements, so he still thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle where it was initially.

11. The answer is C: blue_bucket. Mila thinks Aiden thinks Jacob thinks the sweet_potato is in the blue_bucket.
