 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts on locating the sweet_potato:

1) We are told in step 2 that the sweet_potato is initially in the green_bottle.

2) Jacob, Mila and Elizabeth entered the room but made no movements, so they did not move the sweet_potato.

3) Aiden moved the sweet_potato to the blue_bucket in step 9. At this point, everyone who is still in the room (Amelia) would know it is now in the blue_bucket. 

4) Then Amelia moved the sweet_potato to the green_bottle in step 11. Since Amelia was the last to exit the room, according to Assumption 4 others would tend to trust that it is really in the green_bottle.

5) There are no further indications that the sweet_potato was moved from the green_bottle.

Based on this reasoning, the sweet_potato is most likely really in:

B. green_bottle
