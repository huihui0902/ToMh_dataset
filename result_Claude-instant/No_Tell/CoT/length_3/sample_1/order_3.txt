 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Nathan and Abigail were both in the back_yard when the lettuce was initially in the blue_container (lines 1-2, 9). 

2) Nathan moved the lettuce to the green_cupboard (line 3).

3) Abigail then moved the lettuce to the red_basket (line 9).

4) Isabella then moved the lettuce back to the blue_container (line 11).

5) When Nathan exited the back_yard, he would have witnessed Abigail move the lettuce to the red_basket and Isabella move it back to the blue_container (Assumption 1).

6) Therefore, Nathan would think Abigail thinks the lettuce is in the red_basket (from her last action in the back_yard).

7) However, Abigail would not know where Isabella thinks the lettuce is because they never interacted (Assumption 2).

8) Therefore, Nathan would think Abigail thinks Isabella thinks the lettuce is in the red_basket, even though that is incorrect.

The answer is D. red_drawer.
