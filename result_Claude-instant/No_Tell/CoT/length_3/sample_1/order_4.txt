 Based on the given story and assumptions, here is my step by step reasoning:

1. Isabella last moved the lettuce to the blue_container (Line 11). So Abigail thinks Isabella thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container (Line 32).  

2. Abigail last moved something (the tangerine) before exiting the hallway (Line 31). So Nathan trusts Abigail's knowledge more than Isabella's. So Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the lettuce is in the blue_container.

3. Logan has not been in the same place as Nathan after Nathan exited the backyard (Line 4). So Logan cannot infer what Nathan thinks. 

Therefore, the answer is K. blue_container
