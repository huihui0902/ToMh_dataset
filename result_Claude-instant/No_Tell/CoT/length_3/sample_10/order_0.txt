 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) According to the story, the sweet_potato was initially in the red_container (line 2).

2) Then Ava moved the sweet_potato to the blue_cupboard (line 6).  

3) Next, Evelyn made no movements (line 8) and then exited the kitchen (line 9).  

4) Then, Charlotte moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer (line 10).

5) Finally, William moved the sweet_potato to the red_container (line 12) and then exited the kitchen (line 13).

Based on Assumption 1, that an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place, William was the last one to interact with the sweet_potato and moved it to the red_container.  None of the other agents moved it after that.

So based on the information provided, the answer should be:

F. red_container

How does that logic sound? Let me know if you have any other questions!
