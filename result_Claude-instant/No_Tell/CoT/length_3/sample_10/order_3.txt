 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is:

1) Logan, Evelyn and Charlotte were all in the kitchen together when the sweet_potato was initially in the red_container (statements 1,2). 

2) Evelyn then exited the kitchen before Logan and Charlotte (statements 8,9).

3) When Evelyn exited, she would have seen that the sweet_potato was last moved by Charlotte to the green_drawer (statements 10,11).

4) Then, Logan exited the kitchen (statement 5). Since Logan exited after Evelyn, Logan would trust Evelyn's knowledge more about the sweet_potato's location (assumption 4).

5) Therefore, Logan would think that Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_drawer, as that is where Evelyn last saw it moved when she exited the kitchen.

6) Charlotte exited the kitchen last (statement 11). And since Charlotte trusts agents that exited later (assumption 4), Charlotte would think that Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_drawer.

In summary, based on the assumptions and given information, the answer is:

J. green_drawer

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
