 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet_potato is:

1) Logan and Evelyn were both in the kitchen when the sweet_potato was originally in the red_container.  

2) Evelyn made no movements and stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute before exiting. So she did not move the sweet_potato.

3) After Evelyn exited, Charlotte moved the sweet_potato to the green_drawer, and then William moved it back to the red_container.

4) Evelyn had no more interactions with Logan or the sweet_potato after exiting the kitchen.

5) Based on assumptions 1 and 2, Logan can only infer Evelyn's thoughts based on what they witnessed together in the kitchen.

6) Since Evelyn did not move the sweet_potato, and it was last seen by her in the red_container, Logan would think Evelyn still thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_container.

Therefore, the most likely answer is:
F. red_container

Let me know if this reasoning makes sense and covers all the relevant points in the story and assumptions. I tried to break it down step-by-step based on what Logan and Evelyn witnessed together.
