 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Logan thinks the sweet potato is in the red_container. He witnessed this in step 2 and did not see it moved before he exited in step 5.

2) Ava thinks the sweet potato is in the blue_cupboard. She moved it there in step 6 before exiting in step 7.  

3) Evelyn thinks the sweet potato is in the green_drawer. She witnessed Charlotte move it there in step 10 before exiting in step 9.

4) Charlotte thinks the sweet potato is in the green_drawer. She moved it there herself in step 10 before exiting in step 11.

5) William thinks the sweet potato is in the red_container. He moved it back there in step 12 before exiting in step 13.

So the full thought chain is:

William thinks Charlotte thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks the sweet potato is in the green_drawer.

The answer is: J. green_drawer
