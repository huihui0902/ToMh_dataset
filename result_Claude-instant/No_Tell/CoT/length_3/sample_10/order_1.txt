 Here are my step by step thought processes to solve this question:

1. Evelyn was in the kitchen when the sweet_potato was first mentioned. The story says "The sweet_potato is in the red_container."

2. Evelyn exited the kitchen before any other agent moved the sweet_potato. So at that point in time, she would think it is still in the red_container.

3. After Evelyn exited the kitchen, other agents moved the sweet_potato to different locations. But Evelyn did not witness any of these movements.  

4. Based on Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. So Evelyn would not have witnessed any movements of the sweet_potato after she exited the kitchen.

5. Evelyn also did not have any private or public interactions with the other agents that could inform her of the sweet_potato's location, based on Assumption 2.

6. Therefore, Evelyn would still think the sweet_potato is in the location she last saw it, which is the red_container.

So the answer is F. red_container
