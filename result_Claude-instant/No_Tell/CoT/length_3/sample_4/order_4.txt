 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts:

1) Emma never saw Jackson move the green pepper to the blue container in the living room. So Emma doesn't know where Jackson thinks the green pepper is.

2) Abigail never saw Emma in the living room, so Abigail doesn't know what Emma thinks. 

3) Therefore, Abigail thinks Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is still in the red basket, where it started.

So the answer is F. red_basket
