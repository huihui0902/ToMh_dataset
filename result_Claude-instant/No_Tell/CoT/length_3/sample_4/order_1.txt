 Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1. Emma entered the living room where the green pepper was initially in the red basket (statement 2).  

2. Jackson then moved the green pepper to the blue container (statement 3).  

3. Emma stayed in the living room for 1 minute before exiting (statements 6 and 7).

4. During that time, Emma would have witnessed Jackson moving the green pepper to the blue container.  

5. After exiting the living room, Emma had no further interactions with the green pepper.

Given these facts and assumptions:
- Emma witnessed the green pepper being moved to the blue container 
- Emma had no other information about the green pepper's location afterwards
- Agents tend to tell lies that don't match their actual thoughts

Therefore, Emma most likely thinks the green pepper is in the blue container (option G).

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
