 Okay, here are the steps I took to solve this:

1. Jackson moved the green_pepper to the blue_container in line 3. No other character interacted with the green_pepper after that.
2. Since all characters witnessed everything before exiting a room per Assumption 1, Emma, Abigail and Logan would have seen Jackson move the green_pepper to the blue_container. 
3. Per Assumption 2, the characters can only infer other character's thoughts if they were in the same place. All characters were in the living_room at the beginning, so they all know the green_pepper is in the blue_container.
4. No character interacted with the blue_container after Jackson moved the green_pepper into it.

Based on these steps, the green_pepper is most likely still in the blue_container. So the answer is G: blue_container.

Does this sound reasonable based on the given story and assumptions? Let me know if you have any other questions!
