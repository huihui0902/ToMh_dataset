 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1. According to assumption 1, Benjamin witnessed Jackson moving the green pepper from the red basket to the blue container in the living room.

2. Benjamin, Emma and Abigail were together in the bedroom but there is no mention of the green pepper, so they have no information to share about it. 

3. After that, Benjamin has no more interactions with Emma.

4. Therefore, the only information Benjamin has about the green pepper's location is that Jackson moved it to the blue container in the living room. 

5. Based on assumption 2, Benjamin cannot infer Emma's thoughts about the green pepper's location since they were not together after Benjamin witnessed its movement by Jackson.

6. Therefore, the most logical answer for where Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is located is G. blue_container.

So the answer is G: blue_container
