 Okay, here is my step by step thought process based on the story and assumptions given:

1. Jackson and Benjamin were together in the living room when the green pepper was in the red basket (lines 1-2). 

2. Jackson moved the green pepper to the blue container (line 3).

3. Benjamin witnessed this (assumption 1).

4. Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is in the blue container, since that was the last place Benjamin saw it (assumptions 1 and 4).

5. Jackson and Benjamin were together in the waiting room after the living room (line 15). 

6. Jackson can infer Benjamin's thoughts on where Emma thinks the green pepper is, since they were together in the living room and waiting room (assumption 2).

7. Therefore, Jackson thinks Benjamin thinks Emma thinks the green pepper is in the blue container.

The answer is G. blue_container
