 Okay, here is my reasoning step by step based on the story and assumptions:

1. Noah entered the playroom where the pear originally was in the blue_crate (line 2).

2. Noah witnessed all movements of the pear before he exited the playroom (Assumption 1). 

3. The pear was moved to the blue_suitcase by Noah himself (line 11).

4. Then Aiden moved the pear back to the blue_crate (line 14).

5. Noah witnessed this last movement by Aiden before Noah exited the playroom (Assumption 1).

6. Noah does not trust Aiden's claim since all agents tend to lie (Assumption 3).

7. Noah's last known information about the pear's location is that he himself moved it to the blue_suitcase (line 11).

8. Therefore, Noah really thinks the pear is in the blue_suitcase (Option K).

In summary, based on the story and assumptions provided, the most logical answer is that Noah thinks the pear is in the blue_suitcase (Option K).
