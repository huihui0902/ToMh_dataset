 Okay, here is my logical step by step analysis:

1) Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase (according to line 11)

2) When Aiden exited the playroom in line 15, he saw that the pear was in the blue_crate. He did not witness Noah moving it to the blue_suitcase.

3) Therefore, Aiden thinks the pear is in the blue_crate.

4) Isabella never witnessed anyone moving the pear. The last time she was in the playroom in line 3, it was stated to be in the blue_crate.

5) Therefore, Isabella thinks the pear is in the blue_crate. 

6) William moved the pear to the green_crate in line 9, before he exited the playroom.

7) Therefore, William knows the pear is actually in the green_crate.

8) Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase in line 11, before he exited the playroom.

9) Therefore, Noah knows the pear is actually in the blue_suitcase.

10) Putting this all together:
Aiden thinks Isabella thinks William thinks Noah thinks the pear is in blue_suitcase (L).

The final answer is: L. blue_suitcase
