 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1. William and Noah were not in the same place when the pear's location changed. They were only together in the dining room after the pear's last known location.

2. Therefore, based on Assumption 2, William cannot infer Noah's thoughts about the pear's location directly from interactions with Noah.

3. Based on Assumption 4, William tends to trust agents that exited later than him. Since William exited before Noah from both the playroom and dining room, he may not trust Noah's supposed knowledge of the pear's location.

4. Based on these points, it seems William would not think Noah has any knowledge of the pear's location. He likely thinks Noah thinks the pear's location is unknown.

5. Therefore, the most likely answer is F. green_bathtub, since that is an unlikely location for the pear and indicates Noah's ignorance.

In summary, given that William and Noah were not together when the pear's location changed and that William tends not to trust agents that exited before him, the most likely answer is that William thinks Noah thinks the pear is in an unlikely location, indicating Noah's lack of knowledge.
