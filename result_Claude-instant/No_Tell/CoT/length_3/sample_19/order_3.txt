 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1. Isabella, William and Noah were all in the playroom together initially when the pear was in the blue_crate.

2. Noah moved the pear to the blue_suitcase before exiting the playroom. All agents know this based on Assumption 1.

3. William then moved the pear to the green_crate before exiting. All agents know this. 

4. Finally, Aiden moved the pear back to the blue_crate before exiting. All agents know this.

5. Based on Assumption 2, Isabella can only infer Noah's thought based on what they witnessed together in the playroom.

6. The last thing Noah witnessed was Aiden moving the pear to the blue_crate. 

7. Therefore, Isabella would think William thinks Noah thinks the pear is in the blue_crate, based on Noah's last known location of the pear.

So the answer is L: blue_crate
