 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Abigail and Isla were in the playroom together from the beginning until Abigail exited. 

2) When Abigail exited, the cabbage was in the blue_bathtub according to the story (line 2).

3) Therefore, Abigail knows that Isla thinks the cabbage is in the blue_bathtub.

4) Elizabeth and Isla were in the closet together before entering the waiting room. However, no movements or statements were made, so Elizabeth would not know Isla's thoughts about the cabbage.

5) After leaving the closet, Isla does not state her thoughts publicly or interact privately with Elizabeth.

6) Therefore, Elizabeth would not know Isla's thoughts about the cabbage. She has no basis to think Isla thinks the cabbage is anywhere.

7) Given Assumption 2, for Abigail to think that Elizabeth thinks something about Isla's thoughts, Abigail and Elizabeth must have interacted together after Isla and Abigail's interaction but before Abigail exited the playroom. This did not happen.

8) In summary, Abigail thinks Isla thinks the cabbage is in the blue_bathtub, but Abigail has no basis to think that Elizabeth thinks anything about Isla's thoughts on the cabbage's location.

Therefore, the answer is F: blue_bathtub
