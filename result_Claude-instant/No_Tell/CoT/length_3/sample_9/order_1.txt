 Here is my step by step reasoning:

1) Isla entered the playroom first according to the story. At that point, she witnessed that "The cabbage is in the blue_bathtub." (step 2)

2) Isla then stayed in the playroom for 1 minute and exited. (step 4-5) At this point, she would believe the cabbage is still in the blue_bathtub since she did not witness anyone move it.

3) Isla then entered the closet along with Elizabeth and William. (step 17) However, according to assumption 2, she cannot infer what they are thinking unless they interact or are in the same place. 

4) Isla then stayed in the closet for 1 minute and exited. (steps 23-24) During this time, she did not witness anyone move the cabbage.

5) Isla then re-entered the playroom along with William, Aiden and Abigail. (step 26) At this point, the story states "The cabbage is in the blue_bottle." (step 28)

6) Isla then stayed in the playroom for 1 minute. (step 31) During this time, she moved "the cabbage to the blue_bathtub." (step 31)

7) Given the above reasoning, the option that best fits is:

Where does Isla really think the cabbage is?
F. blue_bathtub

So in summary, based on Isla's direct observations and actions, the blue_bathtub is where she thinks the cabbage currently is.
