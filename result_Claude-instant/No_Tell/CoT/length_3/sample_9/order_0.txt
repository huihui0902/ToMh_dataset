 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step thought process to determine where the cabbage is really located:

1) Initially, the cabbage was in the blue_bathtub (line 2).

2) William moved the cabbage to the blue_treasure_chest (line 8) before exiting the playroom. 

3) Isla then moved the cabbage to the blue_bottle (line 31) before exiting the playroom. 

4) Since Abigail exited the playroom last (line 36), according to assumption 4, the other agents would tend to trust her the most and assume she left the cabbage where it was.

5) Therefore, the cabbage is most likely really in J. blue_bottle.

In summary, based on the information provided and applying the assumptions, my choice for where the cabbage is really located would be J. blue_bottle.
