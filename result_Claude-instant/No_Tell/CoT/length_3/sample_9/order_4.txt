 Okay, here is my step by step analysis of where Aiden thinks Abigail thinks Elizabeth thinks Isla thinks the cabbage is:

1. Isla initially thinks the cabbage is in the blue_bathtub (from line 2).

2. Elizabeth and Abigail did not witness Isla move the cabbage, so they will also think the cabbage is in the blue_bathtub based on Isla's testimony. 

3. William moved the cabbage to the blue_treasure_chest while Isla, Elizabeth and Abigail were not in the playroom (line 8).

4. Then, Aiden moved the cabbage to the blue_bottle while the others were not present (line 10).

5. When Isla reentered the playroom, she witnessed that the cabbage was in the blue_bottle (line 28).

6. Therefore, Isla now thinks the cabbage is in the blue_bottle.

7. Since Elizabeth and Abigail were not present at that time, they still think the cabbage is in the blue_bathtub, based on Isla's earlier testimony.

8. So the answer is: J. blue_bottle
