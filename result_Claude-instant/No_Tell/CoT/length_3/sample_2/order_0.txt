 Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1. The story says the onion was initially in the blue_treasure_chest (line 2).

2. Emily entered the attic first but did not move the onion (line 3). 

3. Charlotte then moved the onion to the green_treasure_chest (line 5).

4. Owen then moved the onion to the red_drawer (line 7).

5. Neither Nathan nor Liam moved the onion, they only stayed in the attic for 1 minute (lines 9 and 11).

6. Based on Assumption 1, all agents witness all movements before exiting an area.

7. Therefore, when the agents entered the waiting_room (line 14), they all knew the onion was in the red_drawer, as that was the last place it was moved to.

Based on this reasoning, my answer is:

N. red_drawer
