 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step reasoning for the question:

1. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute when the onion was last mentioned to be in the red_drawer (story line 7 and 9). 

2. According to Assumption 1, Nathan witnessed the onion being moved to the red_drawer by Owen before Nathan exited the attic.

3. After that, Owen, Liam and Charlotte exited the attic before Nathan (story lines  30 to 37).

4. Based on Assumption 4, Nathan would tend to trust Owen, Liam and Charlotte less since they exited before him.

5. Therefore, Nathan most likely still thinks the onion is in the red_drawer, where he last saw it moved (story line 7).

6. Emily did not enter the attic when the onion was mentioned (story lines 1 to 4).

7. Therefore, Emily would not know where Nathan thinks the onion is. She has no information related to the onion's location.

8. Hence, Owen would think that Emily thinks the onion is in the red_drawer, where Nathan last saw it.

The answer is B. red_pantry
