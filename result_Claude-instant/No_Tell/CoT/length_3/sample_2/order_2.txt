 Okay, here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Emily and Nathan were only together in the attic at the beginning (lines 1-4 and 27-38).

2. When Emily first entered the attic, the onion was in the blue_treasure_chest (line 2). 

3. Emily then exited the attic and did not return until the end (lines 4 and 27).

4. Between Emily exiting and re-entering the attic, Charlotte moved the onion to the green_treasure_chest and then Owen moved it to the red_drawer (lines 5-8).

5. When Emily re-entered the attic at the end, the onion was in the red_drawer (line 28).

6. Nathan made no movements and stayed in the attic for 1 minute both times he was there (lines 9 and 36).

7. Assuming agents witness everything before exiting (Assumption 1), when Emily re-entered the attic she would have seen the onion was in the red_drawer. 

8. Based on Assumption 2, Emily can only infer Nathan's thought about the onion's location based on what they witnessed together in the attic.

Putting this all together, when Emily re-entered the attic at the end, she would have seen that the onion was in the red_drawer. So the answer is:

N. red_drawer
