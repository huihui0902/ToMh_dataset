 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Nathan was in the attic initially when the onion was in the blue_treasure_chest. But he made no movements and stayed there for 1 minute.

2. After Nathan exited the attic, others moved the onion around but Nathan was not present to witness those movements. 

3. When Nathan re-entered the attic later, the onion was said to be in the red_drawer. But again Nathan made no movements and stayed there for 1 minute.  

4. Nathan cannot infer others' thoughts based on Assumption 2, as he did not have any private or public interactions with them.

5. Based on Assumption 4, Nathan would tend to trust others who exited the attic after him. But nobody exited the attic after Nathan.

6. Therefore, Nathan most likely still thinks the onion is in the last location he saw it, which was the blue_treasure_chest as per Step 1.

So the answer is likely: K. blue_treasure_chest
