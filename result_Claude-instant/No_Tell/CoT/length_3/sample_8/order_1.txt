 Step by step reasoning:
> Where does Aiden really think the lemon is?

1) According to the story, Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket in step 7 and exited the garage.  
2) By assumption 1, Aiden witnessed where the lemon was before he moved it.
3) After Aiden exited, Sophia, Jack and Nathan entered and exited the garage. But by assumption 2, Aiden cannot infer their thoughts as they did not interact.
4) Therefore, Aiden's last known location of the lemon is where he left it - the green_basket.

Conclusion: Aiden thinks the lemon is in the green_basket.
The answer is F. green_basket
