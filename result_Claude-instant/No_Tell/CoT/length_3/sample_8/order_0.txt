 Here is my step by step analysis:

1) The lemon started in the green_drawer (fact)
2) Jack moved the lemon to the blue_pantry and exited (fact)
3) Liam moved the lemon to the blue_crate and exited (fact)
4) Aiden moved the lemon to the green_basket and exited (fact)
5) Sophia made no movements and stayed for 1 minute then exited (fact) 
6) Nathan moved the lemon to the green_drawer and exited (fact)

This means the last known location of the lemon was the green_drawer, after Nathan moved and exited the garage.

Assuming agents witness everything before exiting (Assumption 1) and agents tend to trust agents that exited later (Assumption 4), then later exiting agents have more credence.

So according to facts and assumptions, the most likely answer would be:

L. green_drawer
