 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. Nathan and Aiden were together in the cellar. According to assumption 1, Nathan witnessed all of Aiden's movements.

2. In the story, Aiden moved the cherry to the green_crate in the cellar. Nathan witnessed this.

3. According to assumption 2, Nathan can infer Aiden's thoughts only if they were in the same place. Since they were in the cellar together, Nathan can infer something about Aiden's thoughts.  

4. However, according to assumption 3, what a character tells others does not reflect their actual thoughts. So Aiden saying he dislikes lemon does not actually mean he thinks the lemon is elsewhere.

5. The only observable action from which Nathan can infer Aiden's thoughts is Aiden moving the cherry to the green_crate in the cellar. 

6. So based on this limited information, the best answer for where Nathan thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is would be green_crate (answer E).

In summary, the key factors are:

- Nathan witnessed Aiden's only observable action in the cellar 
- That action involved Aiden putting the cherry in the green_crate
- Thus Nathan likely thinks Aiden thinks the lemon is also in the green_crate

Let me know if this analysis makes sense and covers the relevant information. I tried to consider all the given assumptions and information logically.
