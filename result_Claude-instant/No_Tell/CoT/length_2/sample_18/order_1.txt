 Based on the story and assumptions, here are my step by step thoughts to solve the question:

1) According to the story, Sophia was the last one to move the corn in the staircase when Noah was not present. So Sophia knows the corn is in the blue_container.

2) Noah exited the staircase before Sophia, so according to assumption 4, Sophia trusts Noah less and would not believe him if he told her otherwise. Therefore, Sophia thinks the corn is in the blue_container. 

3) However, the question asks where Noah really thinks the corn is, not what he believes others think. Assumption 3 states that every agent tends to lie and what they tell others does not affect their actual thoughts.

4) Noah exited the staircase before anyone else moved the corn. He didn't witness where the corn was moved to. Therefore, Noah's actual thought, where he really thinks the corn is, is based on the initial information given in the story: option K, blue_treasure_chest.

In summary, the answer is option K: Noah really thinks the corn is in the blue_treasure_chest. His exit order, lack of information about later movements, and tendency to lie per assumption 3 points to his "actual thought" being based on the initial information he witnessed.
