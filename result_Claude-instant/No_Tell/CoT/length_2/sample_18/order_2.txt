 Here are the steps to determine where Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is:

1. According to the story, the corn started in the blue_treasure_chest in line 2.

2. Sophia moved the corn to the blue_container in line 10, then exited in line 11.

3. Lily exited last in line 14. According to Assumption 1, she would have witnessed the corn's final location as the blue_container.

4. Noah exited before Sophia in line 9 without witnessing any movements.

5. Isla and Mila exited before Noah in lines 7 and 4. 

6. Lines 17 through 24 refer to movements of the tomato in the front yard, separate from the staircase.

7. Therefore:

- Lily witnessed the corn being moved to the blue_container.

- So she thinks Noah still thinks it's in the blue_treasure_chest where he last saw it.

So Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is in:

K. blue_treasure_chest  

Lily thinks Noah is unaware of any movements after he exited, so he still thinks the corn is in the blue_treasure_chest.
