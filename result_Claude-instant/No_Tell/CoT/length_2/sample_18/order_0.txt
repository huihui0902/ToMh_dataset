 Okay, here are the steps:

1) The corn's last known location according to the story is in line 10 where Sophia moved it to the blue_container.

2) Noah, Mila, and Isla made no movements and did not witness Sophia moving the corn based on lines 3, 5, and 8. 

3) Lily also did not witness anything since she made no movements and exited in line 12, before Sophia moved the corn and exited in lines 10 and 11.

4) Based on Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. Since none of the other agents witnessed Sophia moving the corn to the blue_container, we know that is its real location.

5) Dislike of other objects and exit orders do not affect the real location of the corn.

Therefore, the correct answer is M: blue_container
The corn is really in the blue_container based on Sophia's move in line 10, which none of the other agents witnessed.
