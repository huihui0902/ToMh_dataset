 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the corn started in the blue_treasure_chest.

2. Sophia moved it to the blue_container and exited last.  

3. Mila, Noah and Lily did not move or interact with anyone regarding the corn.   

4. Based on Assumption 1, Sophia would have witnessed the corn's location before moving it.

5. Sophia exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust her.

6. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Sophia claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

7. Putting this together:

Sophia actually moved the corn to the blue_container and exited last. The others would tend to trust her. But her claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts.

Therefore, Isla would think that Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is in the blue_container, where Sophia moved it.

So the answer is M: blue_container

The key points are:

- Sophia moved the corn to the blue_container 
- She exited last, so the others would tend to trust her
- However, her claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts
- Therefore, Isla would think Lily thinks Noah thinks the corn is in the blue_container, matching Sophia's action
