  Here are the steps to determine where Jackson really thinks the tomato is:

1. According to the story, Jackson moved the tomato to the blue_crate in line 5, then exited in line 6.

2. Assumption 3 states that agents tend to lie, so what they say does not reflect reality. We are not told what Jackson said.

3. According to Assumption 1, Jackson witnessed the tomato's location as the blue_crate before he exited.

4. Nathan moved the tomato back to the blue_container in line 11, then exited in line 12.

5. Amelia and Charlotte exited before Jackson in lines 8 and 10 without witnessing any movements.

6. Lines 14 through 24 refer to movements of the onion in the hall, separate from the laundry.

7. Based purely on the events in the story and Assumption 1, Jackson last moved and witnessed the tomato in the blue_crate before he exited.

Therefore, Jackson really thinks the tomato is in:   

L. blue_crate  

Jackson moved the tomato there and last witnessed it there before he exited, so despite later events he thinks it is still in the blue_crate.
