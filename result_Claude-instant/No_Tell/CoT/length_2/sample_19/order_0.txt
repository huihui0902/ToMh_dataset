  Based on the story and assumptions, here are my step by step thoughts to solve the question:

1) According to the story, Nathan was the last one to move the tomato in the laundry. He moved it back to the blue_container. 

2) However, assumption 3 states that agents tend to lie and what they tell others does not affect their actual thoughts. So we cannot take Nathan's final action at face value.

3) We must determine where the tomato actually is based on the initial information and witnessed movements.

4) According to the story, Sophia initially moved the tomato to the blue_cupboard. Then Jackson moved it to the blue_crate.

5) Since the story does not mention the tomato being moved again after that, the tomato is actually (and still) in the blue_crate, option L.

6) Nathan's final action of moving the tomato to the blue_container was a lie per assumption 3, so we cannot consider that the actual location.

In summary, based on the initial information and witnessed movements without considering lies per assumption 3, the tomato is really in option L: the blue_crate. Nathan's final reported location is a lie and cannot be trusted as the real location.
