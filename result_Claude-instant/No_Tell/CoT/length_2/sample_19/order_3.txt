 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Amelia and Nathan were in the laundry together but Amelia exited after Nathan in lines 7 and 11. Based on Assumption 4, Amelia would tend to trust her own observations over Nathan's.

2. When Amelia exited the laundry, the tomato was still in the blue_container according to line 2. She was not aware that Nathan later moved the tomato to the blue_container in line 11.

3. Therefore, Amelia would think that Nathan thinks the tomato is in the blue_container, based on Amelia's last observations before she exited (Assumption 1) and her tendency to trust her own observations over Nathan's (Assumption 4).

4. Amelia and Jackson were in the hall together and Amelia exited after Jackson in lines 20 and 22. Similarly, Amelia would think that Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_container.

5. Following the same logic, Amelia would think that Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_container, based on her own observations and tendency to trust those over Nathan's and Jackson's.

So the answer is K: blue_container. Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_container.

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
