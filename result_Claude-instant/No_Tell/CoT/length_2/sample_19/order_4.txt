 Based on the story and assumptions, here are my step by step thoughts to solve the question:

1) According to the story, Jackson was the last one to move the tomato in the laundry when Sophia was not present. So Jackson knows the tomato is in the blue_crate.

2) Nathan exited the laundry before Jackson, so according to assumption 4, Jackson trusts Nathan less and would not believe him if he told him otherwise. Therefore, Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_crate.

3) Nathan does not know where Jackson moved the tomato to, as he exited the laundry before Jackson. However, according to assumption 2, he can infer Jackson's thoughts since they were together in the laundry and waiting_room. Therefore, Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is in the blue_crate.  

4) Amelia exited the laundry before Nathan, so according to assumption 4, Nathan trusts Amelia less. Therefore, Nathan would not tell Amelia where he thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is.

5) Therefore, Amelia does not know where Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is. She only knows that Nathan exited the laundry before Jackson.

6) Finally, Sophia exited the laundry before Amelia, so according to assumption 4, Sophia trusts Amelia less. Therefore, Sophia would not be able to deduce where Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is.

In summary, the answer is that Sophia thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks Jackson thinks the tomato is in option L: blue_crate.
