  Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the tomato started in the blue_container.

2. Sophia moved it to the blue_cupboard and exited before Jackson.

3. Jackson then moved the tomato to the blue_crate and exited before Amelia.  

4. Nathan moved the tomato back to the blue_container and exited last.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Sophia through Jackson would have witnessed the tomato's location before moving it.  

6. Nathan exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust him.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Nathan claims does not reveal his actual thoughts.

8. Putting this together:  

Nathan actually moved the tomato to the blue_container and exited last. The others would tend to trust him. But his claims are not reliable indicators of his actual thoughts.

Therefore, Nathan would think that Jackson's actual thoughts about the tomato's location match where Nathan moved it, the blue_container.

So the answer is K: blue_container

The key points are:

- Nathan moved the tomato to the blue_container
- He exited last, so the others would tend to trust him
- However, his claims are not reliable indicators of his actual thoughts
- Therefore, Nathan would think Jackson's thoughts match where he moved the tomato, the blue_container
