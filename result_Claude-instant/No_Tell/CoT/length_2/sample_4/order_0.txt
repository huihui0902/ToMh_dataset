 Here are the steps to determine the real location of the potato:

1) Jacob last moved the potato according to the story in line 11 where he moved it to the blue_drawer.   

2) Based on Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. Since Jacob exited the crawlspace after moving the potato to the blue_drawer, he witnessed this last.

3) Dislikes of objects and exit orders of other agents do not impact the real location of the potato.

4) Assumption 3 states that what the characters say does not affect their actual thoughts, so no character's statements provide insight into where the potato really is.

5) The key information is that Jacob last moved the potato to the blue_drawer in line 11 and then exited the crawlspace.

Therefore, based on Jacob's last action and observation before exiting, the potato is really in the blue_drawer.

The answer is B: blue_drawer.

The potato is really in the blue_drawer based on Jacob moving it there in line 11, which he witnessed last before exiting the crawlspace.
