 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Evelyn and Chloe were both initially in the crawlspace, but did not interact or move around. So Evelyn has no information about what Chloe knows.

2) Chloe exited before Mila, so Chloe would not know that Mila moved the potato to the red basket.

3) Isabella then moved the potato to the green bottle. Chloe was not present to witness this.

4) Jacob then moved the potato to the blue drawer, but Chloe was not there to see this.

5) Next, Evelyn, Chloe, Mila and Jacob all entered the waiting room. But there were no interactions mentioned, so no one gained any new information. 

6) Then Evelyn, Mila and Jacob went into the closet. Chloe stayed in the waiting room and did not witness what happened in the closet.

7) Based on the assumptions, since Chloe did not witness Isabella move the potato, or Jacob move the potato, and had no interactions with any of the others after that, the only location Chloe would think the potato is in is the original location: the blue drawer.

Therefore, Evelyn would think Chloe thinks the potato is in the B. blue_drawer.

So my final answer is: B. blue_drawer
