 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. Chloe and Isabella were both in the crawlspace initially but did not interact or speak.

2. Chloe exited before Isabella, so Chloe did not witness Isabella moving the potato to the green_bottle. 

3. The assumption is that agents tend to trust those who exited later than them, so Chloe would not trust Isabella's actions.  

4. Therefore, Chloe would still think the potato is in the blue_drawer, where it was initially.

So the answer is B: blue_drawer
