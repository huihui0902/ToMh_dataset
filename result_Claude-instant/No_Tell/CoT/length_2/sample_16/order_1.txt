 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the tangerine started in the green_bottle.  

2. Liam first moved it to the blue_treasure_chest and exited before Jackson. 

3. Jackson then moved it to the green_bathtub and exited before Carter.

4. Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red_bucket and exited before Sophia.

5. Sophia finally moved it back to the green_bottle and exited last. 

6. Based on Assumption 1, Liam through Benjamin would have witnessed the tangerine's location before moving it.

7. Benjamin exited before Sophia, so based on Assumption 4 he would not tend to trust Sophia.

8. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Sophia claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

9. Putting this together:

Benjamin exited before Sophia. He does not tend to trust Sophia. But Sophia's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts.

Therefore, Benjamin's actual thoughts should match the location he moved the tangerine to, the red_bucket.

So the answer is K: red_bucket

The key points are:

- Benjamin moved the tangerine to the red_bucket
- He exited before Sophia, so he would not tend to trust her  
- However, Sophia's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts
- Therefore, Benjamin's actual thoughts should match where he moved the tangerine, the red_bucket
