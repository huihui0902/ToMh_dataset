 Okay, here are the steps:

1. Liam and Benjamin were in the den together in lines 1 and 15. Based on Assumption 2, Liam can infer Benjamin's thoughts.

2. Liam last exited the den in line 5, while Benjamin exited in line 18. Based on Assumption 4, Liam would tend to trust his own observations over Benjamin's. 

3. When Liam last exited the den in line 5, the tangerine was in the green_bathtub according to line 3, where Liam moved the tangerine there.

4. However, Benjamin moved the tangerine after Liam exited, to the red_bucket according to line 10. 

5. Since Liam exited earlier than Benjamin from the den, Liam is not aware of Benjamin's later move to the red_bucket. 

6. Therefore, Liam would think that Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the green_bathtub, based on Liam's own last observations before exiting (Assumptions 2, 4) and ignorance of Benjamin's later move (Assumption 1).

So the answer is N: green_bathtub
