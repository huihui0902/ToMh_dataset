 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1) According to the story, Benjamin was the last one to move the tangerine in the den when Liam and Carter were not present, so Benjamin knows the tangerine is in the red_bucket.  

2) Carter exited the den before Benjamin, so according to assumption 4, Benjamin trusts Carter less and would not believe him if he told him otherwise. Therefore, Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the red_bucket.

3) Carter does not know where Benjamin moved the tangerine to, as he exited the den before Benjamin. However, according to assumption 2, he can infer Benjamin's thoughts since they were together in the den and waiting_room. Therefore, Carter thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in the red_bucket.   

4) Liam exited the den before Carter, so according to assumption 4, Carter trusts Liam less. Therefore, Carter would not tell Liam where he thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is.

5) Therefore, Liam does not know where Carter thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is.

In summary, the answer is that Carter thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the tangerine is in option K: red_bucket.
