 Here are the steps to determine where Lily thinks Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is:

1. According to the story, the lime started in the red_bottle in line 3.  

2. Lily moved the lime to the blue_drawer in line 4, then exited in line 5.

3. Ella exited before Lily in line 7. So she would have witnessed the lime in the blue_drawer.

4. Owen exited after Ella in line 9 without witnessing any movements.

5. Evelyn moved the lime to the green_pantry in line 10, then exited in line 12.

6. Emily exited last in line 14. According to Assumption 1, she would have witnessed the lime's final location as the green_pantry.  

7. Lines 16 through 26 refer to movements of the lettuce in the attic, separate from the front yard.

8. Therefore:

- Lily last saw the lime in the blue_drawer before exiting.  

- So she thinks Emily witnessed it being moved to the green_pantry after she exited.

- She thinks Emily thinks Owen still thinks it's in the blue_drawer.

So Lily thinks Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in:

C. blue_drawer

Lily thinks Owen is unaware of any movements after he exited, so he still thinks the lime is in the blue_drawer where Lily last moved it.
