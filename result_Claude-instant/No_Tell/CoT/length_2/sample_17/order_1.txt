 Okay, here are the steps:

1. Owen was not present when any movement of the lime happened according to the story. He was only in the front_yard when the lime was initially in the red_bottle.

2. Based on Assumption 2, Owen cannot infer anyone else's thoughts since he did not share a place or interact with them.

3. Assumption 3 states that what the characters say does not affect their actual thoughts, so Ella liking the red_bottle in line 2 does not give any insight into where Owen thinks the lime is.

4. The key information is that Owen made no movements and witnessed nothing before exiting the front_yard in line 9.

5. Therefore, based solely on Owen's initial observation when entering, he would actually think the lime is still in the red_bottle where it was originally in line 3.

So the answer is A: red_bottle

The insight is that in the absence of any new information or interactions, Owen would retain his initial observation and assumption that the lime remains where he last saw it. Liking a certain object by another character does not change Owen's own thoughts.

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
