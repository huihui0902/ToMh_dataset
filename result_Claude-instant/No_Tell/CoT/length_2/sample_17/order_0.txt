 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 3, the lime started in the red_bottle.

2. Lily first moved it to the blue_drawer and exited before Ella.  

3. Evelyn then moved the lime to the green_pantry and exited last.

4. Owen and Emily did not move or interact with anyone regarding the lime.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Lily and Evelyn would have witnessed the lime's location before moving it.

6. Evelyn exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust her.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Evelyn claims does not reveal its actual location.

8. Putting this together:

Evelyn actually moved the lime to the green_pantry and exited last. The others would tend to trust her. But her claims are not reliable indicators of its actual location.  

Therefore, the lime's actual location should match where Evelyn moved it, the green_pantry.

So the answer is B: green_pantry

The key points are:

- Evelyn moved the lime to the green_pantry
- She exited last, so the others would tend to trust her 
- However, her claims are not reliable indicators of its actual location
- Therefore, the lime's actual location should match where Evelyn moved it, the green_pantry
