 Based on the story and assumptions, here are my step by step thoughts to solve the question:

1) According to the story, Evelyn was the last one to move the lime in the front_yard when Owen and Emily were not present. So Evelyn knows the lime is in the green_pantry.

2) Owen exited the front_yard before Evelyn, so according to assumption 4, Evelyn trusts Owen less and would not believe him if he told her otherwise. Therefore, Evelyn thinks the lime is in the green_pantry.

3) Owen does not know where Evelyn moved the lime to, as he exited the front_yard before her. However, according to assumption 2, he can infer Evelyn's thoughts since they were together in the front_yard and waiting_room. Therefore, Owen thinks Evelyn thinks the lime is in the green_pantry.

4) Emily exited the front_yard before Owen, so according to assumption 4, Owen trusts Emily less. Therefore, Owen would not tell Emily where he thinks the lime is.

5) Therefore, Emily does not know where Owen thinks the lime is. She only knows that Owen exited the front_yard before Evelyn.

In summary, the answer is that Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in option B: green_pantry.
