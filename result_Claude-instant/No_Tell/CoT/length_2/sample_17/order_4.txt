  Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to the story, Evelyn moved the lime to the green_pantry and exited last.  

2. Owen, Lily and Ella did not move or interact with anyone regarding the lime.

3. Ella exited before Evelyn, so based on Assumption 4 she would not tend to trust Evelyn.

4. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Evelyn claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

5. Evelyn actually moved the lime to the green_pantry.

6. Owen exited before Lily, so Lily would tend not to trust Owen based on Assumption 4.

7. However, Owen did not do anything to indicate his actual thoughts about the lime's location.

8. Putting this together:

Ella would think that Lily thinks that Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is somewhere other than the green_pantry, despite Evelyn actually moving it there.  

But Evelyn actually moved the lime to the green_pantry, so that is her actual thought about its location.

Therefore, Ella would think that Lily thinks Emily thinks Owen thinks the lime is in the green_pantry, matching Evelyn's actual action.

So the answer is B: green_pantry

The key points are:

- Evelyn actually moved the lime to the green_pantry  
- Ella would not trust Evelyn
- Lily would not trust Owen
- But Owen's actual thoughts are unclear
- So Ella thinks Lily thinks Emily thinks Owen thinks it's the green_pantry, matching Evelyn's action
