 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to the story, the cherry started in the red_drawer.

2. Emily moved it to the red_container and exited first. 

3. Emma then moved it to the green_envelope and exited before Avery.

4. Avery finally moved it to the blue_suitcase and exited last.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Emma and Avery would have witnessed the cherry's location before they moved it.

6. Avery exited last, so based on Assumption 4, Lily and Ella would tend to trust Avery.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Avery claims does not reveal actual thoughts.

8. Putting this together:

Avery actually moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase and exited last. Lily and Ella would tend to trust Avery. But Avery's claims are not reliable indicators of actual thoughts.

Therefore, Ella would think that Lily thinks Avery actually thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase, where Avery moved it.

So the answer is H: blue_suitcase  

The key points are:

- Avery moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase
- Avery exited last, so Lily and Ella would tend to trust him
- However, Avery's claims are not reliable indicators of actual thoughts
- Therefore, Ella would think Lily thinks Avery actually thinks it's in the blue_suitcase, where he moved it
