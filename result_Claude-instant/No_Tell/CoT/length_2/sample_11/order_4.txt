  Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Emily moved the cherry to the red_container and exited first. (Lines 3 and 4) 

2) She last saw the cherry in the red_container. (Lines 3 and 4)

3) Emma moved the cherry to the green_envelope after Emily exited. (Lines 7 and 8)  

4) Avery moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase after Emma exited. (Lines 9 and 10)   

5) Avery was the last one to move the cherry and exit the pantry. (Lines 9 and 10)

6) Ella exited after Avery but did not move the cherry. (Lines 11 and 12) 

7) Ella last saw the cherry in the green_envelope. (Lines 7 and 8, 11 and 12)

8) Lily exited before Avery but did not see him move the cherry. (Lines 5 and 6)

9) Lily last saw the cherry in the red_container. (Lines 3 and 5)

10) Emily can only infer Ella's thoughts through Lily, and Lily's thoughts through Avery.

11) So Emily would think Ella thinks Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope, where Ella last saw it.

The answer is I. green_envelope.
This is where Emily thinks Ella thinks Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is, based on their exit order.
