   Okay, here is my reasoning step-by-step:

1) Avery moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase (line 9). This shows that Avery actually thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.

2) Though Lily likes the red_drawer (line 19), according to Assumption 3 every agent tends to lie so what they say does not affect their actual thoughts.

3) Avery exited before Ella (line 10 vs line 12), so no one else's thoughts or actions after Avery exited would change where Avery actually thinks the cherry is.

Therefore, Avery really thinks the cherry is in:

H. blue_suitcase

The key is that Avery's last actions before exiting, where he could still witness everything according to Assumption 1, show his actual thoughts on the cherry's location. What others say or do after he exits is irrelevant.
