 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Emily moved the cherry to the red_container and exited first. (Lines 3 and 4)

2) Emma moved the cherry to the green_envelope after Emily exited.(Lines 7 and 8)  

3) Avery moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase after Emma exited. (Lines 9 and 10)

4) Avery was the last one to move the cherry and exit the pantry. (Lines 9 and 10)

5) Ella exited after Avery but did not move the cherry. (Lines 11 and 12)

6) Since Avery was the last to move and exit the pantry, his move to the blue_suitcase is the last recorded movement of the cherry.

Therefore, the cherry is really in H. blue_suitcase. This is where Avery, the last person to move and exit the pantry, moved the cherry.
