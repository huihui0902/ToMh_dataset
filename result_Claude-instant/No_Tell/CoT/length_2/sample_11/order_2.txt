 Here are the steps to determine where Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is:

1. According to the story, the cherry started in the red_drawer in line 2.  

2. Emily moved the cherry to the red_container in line 3, then exited in line 4.

3. Emma moved the cherry to the green_envelope in line 7, then exited in line 8.  

4. Avery moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase in line 9, then exited in line 10.

5. According to Assumption 1, Avery witnessed the cherry's final location as the blue_suitcase before he exited.

6. Ella exited last in line 12 without witnessing any movements.

7. Lily exited before Avery in line 17. So she would have witnessed the cherry in the green_envelope.

8. Lines 14 through 23 refer to movements of the tomato in the cellar, separate from the pantry.

9. Therefore, Lily last witnessed the cherry in the green_envelope. So she thinks Avery witnessed it being moved to the blue_suitcase after she exited.

So Lily thinks Avery thinks the cherry is in:

H. blue_suitcase

Lily knows Avery exited after her and thus witnessed the final location in the blue_suitcase.
