  Based on the story and assumptions, here are my step by step thoughts to solve the question:

1) According to the story, Amelia was the last one to move the corn in the hallway when Lily and Sophia were not present. So Amelia knows the corn is in the red_basket.

2) Lily exited the hallway before Amelia, so according to assumption 4, Amelia trusts Lily less and would not believe her if she told her otherwise. Therefore, Amelia thinks the corn is in the red_basket.  

3) Lily does not know where Amelia moved the corn to, as she exited the hallway before Amelia. However, according to assumption 2, she can infer Amelia's thoughts since they were together in the hallway and waiting_room. Therefore, Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the red_basket.

4) Finally, Sophia exited the hallway before Lily, so according to assumption 4 Sophia trusts Lily less. Therefore, Sophia would not be able to deduce where Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is.

In summary, the answer is that Sophia thinks Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in option B: red_basket.
