 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the corn started in the red_basket.

2. Liam first moved it to the red_container and exited before Sophia.  

3. Amelia moved the corn back to the red_basket and exited last.  

4. Lily and Carter did not move or interact with anyone regarding the corn.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Liam and  Amelia would have witnessed the corn's location before moving it.

6. Amelia exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust her.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Amelia claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

8. Putting this together:

Amelia actually moved the corn to the red_basket and exited last. The others would tend to trust her. But her claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts. 

Therefore, Amelia's actual thoughts should match where she moved the corn, the red_basket.

So the answer is B: red_basket

The key points are:

- Amelia moved the corn to the red_basket
- She exited last, so the others would tend to trust her   
- However, her claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts
- Therefore, Amelia's actual thoughts should match where she moved the corn, the red_basket
