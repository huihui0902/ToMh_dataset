 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Lily and Amelia were never in the same place or had any interactions according to the story, so based on Assumption 2 Lily cannot infer Amelia's thoughts.

2. Lily last exited the hallway in line 8, before Amelia moved the corn in line 11. Based on Assumption 1, Lily did not witness this movement.

3. When Lily exited the hallway in line 8, the corn was still in the red_container according to line 3. Lily is unaware that Amelia later moved the corn to the red_basket.  

4. Therefore, Lily would think that Amelia thinks the corn is still in the red_container, based on Lily's own last observations before exiting (Assumption 1) and ignorance of Amelia's later move (also Assumption 1).

5. Dislikes of objects by other agents do not affect what Lily thinks Amelia thinks.

The answer is therefore C: red_container. Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the red_container.
