 Okay, here are the steps to determine where the cucumber is really:

1. According to the story, the cucumber started in the green_treasure_chest in line 2.

2. Ava exited first without witnessing any movements in line 4.

3. Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red_envelope in line 5, then exited in line 6.

4. Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_crate in line 7, then exited in line 8.

5. William exited after Charlotte without witnessing any movements in line 10.

6. Jacob moved the cucumber to the green_treasure_chest in line 11, then exited in line 12.

7. According to Assumption 1, Jacob witnessed the cucumber's final location as the green_treasure_chest before he exited.

8. Lines 14 through 22 refer to the movements of the watermelon in the pantry, which is separate from the dining room. So those events do not impact the location of the cucumber.

9. Assumption 3 states that agents tend to lie, so what they say does not reflect reality. We are not told what any agents said.

10. Therefore, based purely on the events in the story and Assumption 1, the cucumber is most likely actually in:  

G. green_treasure_chest

Jacob last moved and witnessed the cucumber in the green_treasure_chest, and no evidence contradicts this. So the cucumber is really in the green_treasure_chest.
