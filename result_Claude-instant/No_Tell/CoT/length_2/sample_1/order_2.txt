 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Ava exited the dining room before anyone moved the cucumber. (Line 4)

2) Ava did not witness anyone move the cucumber. (Assumption 1)  

3) Ava last saw the cucumber in the green_treasure_chest. (Line 2)

4) Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red_envelope and exited. (Lines 5 and 6)  

5) Ava cannot infer Evelyn's thoughts directly since they were never in the same place. (Assumption 2)

6) Therefore, Ava can only think that Evelyn still thinks the cucumber is where Ava last saw it, in the green_treasure_chest.

The answer is: G. green_treasure_chest

This is where Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the cucumber is, based on Ava's lack of information about Evelyn's actual move after Ava exited.
