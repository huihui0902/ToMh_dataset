 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the cucumber started in the green_treasure_chest.

2. Evelyn first moved it to the red_envelope and exited first. 

3. Charlotte then moved it to the red_crate and exited before William.

4. Jacob finally moved it back to the green_treasure_chest and exited last.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Evelyn would have witnessed the cucumber in the green_treasure_chest before she moved it.

6. Evelyn exited before Jacob, so based on Assumption 4, she would not tend to trust Jacob.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Jacob claims does not reveal his actual thoughts.

8. Putting this together:

Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red_envelope and exited first. She does not tend to trust Jacob. But Jacob's claims are not reliable indicators of his actual thoughts.

Therefore, Evelyn's actual thoughts should match the location she moved the cucumber to, the red_envelope.

So the answer is F: red_envelope

The key points are:

- Evelyn moved the cucumber to the red_envelope 
- She exited first, before Jacob  
- Evelyn would not tend to trust Jacob who exited after her
- However, Jacob's claims are not reliable indicators of his actual thoughts
- Therefore, Evelyn's actual thoughts should match where she moved the cucumber, the red_envelope
