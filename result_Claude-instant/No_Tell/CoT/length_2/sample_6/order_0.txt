 Here are my step by step thoughts analyzing the story:

1. Owen, Avery, Benjamin, Mila and Noah entered the bedroom. - All 5 characters entered the bedroom initially.

2. The melon is in the red_pantry. - The melon's initial location is given. 

3. Owen moved the melon to the green_basket. - Owen moved the melon  from the red_pantry to the green_basket.

4. Owen exited the bedroom. - Owen left the bedroom.

5. Avery saw a monkey. - Avery witnessed a monkey. However, this is irrelevant to the melon's location.

6. Avery made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute. - Avery did not move the melon.

7. Avery exited the bedroom. - Avery left the bedroom.

8. Owen likes the red_basket. - This is irrelevant to the melon's location.

9. Benjamin made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute. - Benjamin did not move the melon.

10. Benjamin exited the bedroom. - Benjamin left the bedroom.

11. Mila moved the melon to the green_box. - Mila moved the melon from the green_basket to the green_box. 

12. Mila exited the bedroom. - Mila left the bedroom.

13. Noah moved the melon to the red_pantry. - Noah moved the melon from the green_box to the red_pantry.

14. Noah exited the bedroom. - Noah left the bedroom.

Based on the above analysis, the answer should be:

F. red_pantry, as Noah last moved the melon there in step 13 before exiting the bedroom.
