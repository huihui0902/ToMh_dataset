 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Owen thought the melon was in the red_pantry (according to line 3) 

2) Avery never interacted with Owen and did not witness what Owen did. So Avery has no basis to think that Owen thought the melon was anywhere.

3) Benjamin did not witness anything in the bedroom and never interacted with Owen or Avery. So Benjamin has no basis to think where Avery thought Owen thought the melon was.

4) Noah witnessed Mila moving the melon to the green_box (line 11) but he did not witness anything that Avery or Benjamin did.  

5) Therefore, Noah would think that Benjamin thinks that Avery thinks that Owen thinks the melon is in the green_box.

So the answer is: J. green_box
