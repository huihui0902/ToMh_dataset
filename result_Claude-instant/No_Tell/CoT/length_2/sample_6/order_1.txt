 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts to solve this question:

1) Owen entered the bedroom where the melon was initially located in the red_pantry according to statement 2. 

2) Owen exited the bedroom in statement 4, so he likely still thought the melon was in the red_pantry at that point. 

3) After Owen exited, other agents moved the melon to different locations but Owen did not witness those movements based on Assumption 1.

4) Owen also did not have any private or public interactions with the other agents based on Assumption 2, so he could not infer their thoughts.

5) According to Assumption 3, agents tend to lie, so their public claims cannot be trusted.

6) Putting everything together, Owen most likely still thinks the melon is located in the red_pantry, where he last saw it before exiting the bedroom. This is option F.

Therefore, the answer is F: red_pantry
