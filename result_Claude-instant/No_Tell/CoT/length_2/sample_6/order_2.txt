 Here are my step by step thoughts on this problem:

1. From story statements 1-5, Owen and Avery were both in the bedroom when the melon was first mentioned as being in the red_pantry. 

2. According to assumption 1, agents witness everything before exiting a place. So Avery witnessed Owen move the melon to the green_basket.  

3. Avery then exited the bedroom and did not interact with or observe Owen again based on the given info.

4. According to assumption 4, agents tend to trust agents that exited a room later than themselves. Since Owen exited the bedroom after Avery, Avery would trust Owen's knowledge more than his own.

5. Therefore, based on what Avery witnessed Owen do in the bedroom, and the fact that Avery would tend to trust Owen's knowledge more, Avery would think Owen thinks the melon is in the green_basket.

So the answer is G: green_basket

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
