 Step by step analysis:

1) Benjamin was in the bedroom when Owen moved the melon to the green basket (lines 2-3). So based on assumption (1), Benjamin knows Owen thought the melon was in the green basket. 

2) Avery was also in the bedroom at this time, so based on assumption (2), Benjamin knows Avery would know Owen thought the melon was in the green basket.  

3) However, assumption (3) states that characters tend to lie, so their claims don't reflect their actual thoughts.

4) Based on all this, Benjamin would think Avery thinks Owen thinks the melon is in the green basket, option G.

Therefore, the answer is: G. green_basket
