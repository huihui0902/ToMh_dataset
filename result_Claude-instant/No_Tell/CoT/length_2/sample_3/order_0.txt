 Here are the steps:

1) Mila last moved the peas according to the story in line 10 where she moved them to the blue_crate.

2) Based on Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. Since Mila exited the workshop after moving the peas to the blue_crate, she witnessed this last.

3) Dislikes of objects and sightings of animals by other agents do not impact the real location of the peas.

4) Assumption 3 states that what the characters say does not affect their actual thoughts, so Liam disliking the peas in line 4 does not provide insight into where the peas really are.

5) The key information is that Mila last moved the peas to the blue_crate in line 10 and then exited the workshop.

Therefore, based on Mila's last action and observation before exiting, the peas are really in the blue_crate.

The answer is M: blue_crate

The peas are really in the blue_crate based on Mila moving them there in line 10, which she witnessed last before exiting the workshop.
