 Here are the steps to determine where Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is:

1. According to the story, Noah moved the peas to the green_crate in line 6 and then exited in line 7.

2. Avery moved the peas to the blue_bucket in line 8, then exited in line 9. 

3. Mila moved the peas to the blue_crate in line 10, then exited in line 12.

4. Benjamin exited last in line 14. According to Assumption 1, he would have witnessed the peas' final location as the blue_crate.

5. Liam exited before Noah in line 5 without witnessing any movements.

6. Lines 16 through 24 refer to movements of the melon in the den, separate from the workshop.

7. Therefore:

- Noah last saw the peas in the green_crate before exiting.

- So he thinks Benjamin witnessed them being moved to the blue_crate after he exited.   

So Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is in:

M. blue_crate

Noah thinks Benjamin last saw the peas in the blue_crate where Mila left them.

In summary, from Noah's perspective, Benjamin witnessed the final move that put the peas in the blue_crate, so he thinks Benjamin believes they are in the blue_crate.
