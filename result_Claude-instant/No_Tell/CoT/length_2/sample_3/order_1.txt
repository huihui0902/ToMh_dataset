  Based on the story and assumptions, here are my step by step thoughts to solve the question:

1) The question asks where Benjamin really thinks the peas is, not what others think he thinks. We must find Benjamin's actual thoughts, not inferred thoughts.

2) Assumption 3 states that every agent tends to lie and what they tell others does not reflect their actual thoughts.

3) According to the story, Benjamin made no movements and simply stayed in the workshop for 1 minute before exiting. He did not witness where the peas was moved to after his entrance.

4) Therefore, Benjamin's actual thought about where the peas is must be based on the initial information given in the story: option K, the green_drawer.

5) All subsequent movements happened after Benjamin exited the workshop, so he has no knowledge of those locations. His "actual thought" is based only on the initial information he witnessed upon entering.

In summary, the answer is that Benjamin really thinks the peas is in option K: the green_drawer. His lack of information about later movements and tendency to lie per assumption 3 points to his "actual thought" being based on the initial information he first witnessed upon entering the workshop.
