  Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the peas started in the green_drawer.

2. Liam first moved it to the blue_container and exited before Noah.

3. Noah then moved the peas to the green_crate and exited before Avery.  

4. Avery moved the peas to the blue_bucket and exited before Mila.

5. Mila finally moved the peas to the blue_crate and exited last.

6. Based on Assumption 1, all agents except Benjamin would have witnessed the peas's location before moving it.

7. Mila exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust her.

8. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Mila claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

9. Putting this together:

Avery would think that Liam thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is in the blue_crate, where Mila actually moved them.

So the answer is M: blue_crate  

The key points are:

- Mila moved the peas to the blue_crate
- She exited last, so the others would tend to trust her  
- However, her claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts  
- Therefore, Avery would think Liam thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the peas is where Mila moved them, the blue_crate
