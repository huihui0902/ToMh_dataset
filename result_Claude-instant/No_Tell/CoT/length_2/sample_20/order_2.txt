  Based on the story and assumptions, here are my step by step thoughts to solve the question:

1) According to the story, Nathan was the last one to move the peas in the bathroom when Emily was not present. So Nathan knows the peas is in the blue_suitcase.

2) Emily exited the bathroom before Nathan, so according to assumption 4, Nathan trusts Emily less and would not believe her if she told him otherwise. Therefore, Nathan thinks the peas is in the blue_suitcase.

3) However, the question asks where Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas is. Emily does not know where Nathan moved the peas to.

4) Emily exited the bathroom before Nathan, so according to assumption 4, Nathan trusts Emily less. Therefore, Nathan would not tell Emily where he thinks the peas is.

5) Therefore, Emily does not know where Nathan thinks the peas is. She only knows that Nathan exited the bathroom after Avery and Evelyn.

In summary, based on the information Emily has, the answer is option A: blue_suitcase. Emily does not actually know where Nathan thinks the peas is, so we select the location that Nathan does know - where he actually moved the peas to.
