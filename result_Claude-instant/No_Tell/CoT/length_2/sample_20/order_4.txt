   Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to the story, Nathan moved the peas to the blue_suitcase and exited last.

2. Evelyn, Ella and Emily did not move or interact with anyone regarding the peas. 

3. Evelyn exited before Nathan, so based on Assumption 4 she would not tend to trust Nathan.

4. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Nathan claims does not reveal his actual thoughts.  

5. Nathan actually moved the peas to the blue_suitcase.

6. Emily exited before Ella, so Ella would tend not to trust Emily based on Assumption 4.  

7. However, Emily did move the peas, indicating her actual thoughts about their location.

8. Putting this together:

Evelyn would think that Ella thinks that Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas are somewhere other than the blue_suitcase, despite Nathan actually moving them there.

But Nathan actually moved the peas to the blue_suitcase, so that is his actual thought about their location.

Therefore, Evelyn would think that Ella thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas are in the blue_suitcase, matching Nathan's actual action.

So the answer is A: blue_suitcase

The key points are:

- Nathan actually moved the peas to the blue_suitcase  
- Evelyn would not trust Nathan
- Ella would not trust Emily 
- But Emily did move the peas  
- So Evelyn thinks Ella thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks it's the blue_suitcase, matching Nathan's action
