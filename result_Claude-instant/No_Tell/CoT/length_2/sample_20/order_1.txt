  Here are the steps to determine Nathan's real thought on the location of the peas:

1. Nathan last moved the peas in line 12, placing them in the blue_suitcase.

2. Based on Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. Since Nathan exited the bathroom after moving the peas to the blue_suitcase, he witnessed this last.

3. Dislikes of objects by other agents and exit orders do not impact Nathan's actual thoughts.

4. Assumption 3 states that what the characters say does not affect their actual thoughts, so Evelyn disliking the potato in line 1 does not provide insight into where Nathan thinks the peas are.

5. The key information is that Nathan last moved the peas to the blue_suitcase in line 12 and then exited the bathroom.

Therefore, based on his own last action and observation before exiting, Nathan would actually think the peas are in the blue_suitcase.

The answer is A: blue_suitcase

Nathan's real thought about the location of the peas would be that they are in the blue_suitcase, based on his moving them there in line 12 and then exiting the bathroom.
