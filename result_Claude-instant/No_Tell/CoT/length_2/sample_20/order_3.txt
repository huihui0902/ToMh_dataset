  Here are the steps to determine where Ella thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas is:

1. According to the story, Ella moved the peas to the red_envelope in line 6 and then exited in line 7.   

2. Avery moved the peas to the blue_cupboard in line 8, then exited in line 9.

3. Evelyn exited before Avery in line 11 without witnessing any movements.

4. Nathan moved the peas to the blue_suitcase in line 12, then exited in line 13.

5. Emily exited before Ella in line 5. So she witnessed the peas in the red_envelope.

6. Putting this together:

- Ella last saw the peas in the red_envelope before exiting.  

- So she thinks Emily still thinks they're there.

- She thinks Emily thinks Nathan last moved them to the blue_suitcase.

Therefore, Ella thinks Emily thinks Nathan thinks the peas is in:

A. blue_suitcase

Ella thinks Emily is unaware that Avery moved the peas to the blue_cupboard, so Emily still thinks they're in the red_envelope where Ella last moved them.

In summary, from Ella's perspective, Emily does not know about Avery's move to the blue_cupboard and still thinks the final location is the red_envelope where Ella last moved the peas.
