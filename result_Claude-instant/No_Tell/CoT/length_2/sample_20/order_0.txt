 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 3, the peas started in the blue_suitcase.

2. Emily first moved it to the red_basket and exited before Ella.

3. Avery then moved the peas to the blue_cupboard and exited before Evelyn.  

4. Nathan finally moved the peas to blue_suitcase and exited last.

5. Based on Assumption 1, all agents except Evelyn would have witnessed the peas' location before moving it. 

6. Nathan exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust him.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Nathan claims does not reveal its actual location.

8. Putting this together:

Nathan actually moved the peas to the blue_suitcase and exited last. The others would tend to trust him. But his claims are not reliable indicators of its actual location.  

Therefore, the peas' actual location should match where Nathan moved it, the blue_suitcase.

So the answer is A: blue_suitcase

The key points are:

- Nathan moved the peas to the blue_suitcase
- He exited last, so the others would tend to trust him
- However, his claims are not reliable indicators of its actual location
- Therefore, the peas' actual location should match where Nathan moved it, the blue_suitcase
