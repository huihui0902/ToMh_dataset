 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solving this question:

1. According to the story, the melon was initially in the blue_container (line 2).

2. Evelyn moved the melon to the green_treasure_chest (line 3) before exiting the hallway (line 4). 

3. Based on Assumption 1, Evelyn would have witnessed the melon's location as green_treasure_chest before she exited.

4. No one else in the hallway interacted with or moved the melon according to the story.

5. When the characters entered the waiting room (line 15), the melon's location was still green_treasure_chest based on what Evelyn knew.

6. In the cellar (lines 16 to 24), only Nathan and Isabella interacted with the melon. Nathan first moved it to the blue_bottle (line 18) and then Isabella moved it to the red_bottle (line 20).

7. Evelyn witnessed the melon's final location as the red_bottle before she exited the cellar (line 24).

8. Based on all this information and the story given, the melon's actual location is H: red_bottle.

So the answer is H: red_bottle
