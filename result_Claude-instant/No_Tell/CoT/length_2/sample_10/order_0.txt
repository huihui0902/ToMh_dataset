  Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the orange started in the red_pantry.

2. Jack moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest and exited before Alexander.

3. Alexander did not move or interact with anyone.  

4. Chloe then moved the orange to the red_container and exited last.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Jack would have witnessed the orange in the red_pantry before he moved it.

6. Jack exited before Chloe, so based on Assumption 4, he would not tend to trust Chloe.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Chloe claims does not reveal her actual thoughts. 

8. Putting this together:

Jack moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest and exited before Chloe. He does not tend to trust Chloe. But Chloe's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts.

Therefore, the orange's actual location should match where Jack moved it, the blue_treasure_chest.

So the answer is C: blue_treasure_chest

The key points are:

- Jack moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest
- Jack exited before Chloe, so he would not tend to trust her 
- However, Chloe's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts
- Therefore, the orange's actual location should match where Jack moved it, the blue_treasure_chest
