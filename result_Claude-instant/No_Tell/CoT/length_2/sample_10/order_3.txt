  Here are the steps to determine where Jack thinks Aiden thinks Hannah thinks the orange is:

1. According to the story, the orange started in the red_pantry in line 2.

2. Hannah exited first in line 4 before any movements occurred. So she would still think the orange is in the red_pantry.

3. Jack moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest in line 5, then exited in line 6.   

4. Alexander exited after Jack in line 8, so he would have seen the orange in the blue_treasure_chest.

5. Chloe moved the orange to the red_container in line 9, then exited in line 10.

6. Aiden exited last in line 12. According to Assumption 1, he would have witnessed the orange's final location as the red_container.

7. Lines 14 through 22 refer to movements of the pear in the front yard, separate from the master bedroom.

8. Putting this together: Jack exited before the final move to the red_container. So he thinks Aiden witnessed that final move. Jack thinks Aiden thinks Hannah still thinks the orange is in the red_pantry where she last saw it.

Therefore, Jack thinks Aiden thinks Hannah thinks the orange is in:  

B. red_pantry  

Jack thinks Aiden witnessed the final location but Jack thinks Aiden knows Hannah is not aware of any movements after she exited.
