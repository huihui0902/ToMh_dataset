 Here are the step-by-step thoughts to solve this problem:

1. According to the story, Jack moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest and exited before Alexander.

2. Aiden, Hannah and Jack did not interact with anyone regarding the orange.

3. Alexander exited after Jack, so based on Assumption 4 he would tend to trust Jack.

4. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Jack claims does not reveal his actual actions.

5. Jack actually moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest.

6. Hannah exited before Jack, so Jack would tend not to trust Hannah based on Assumption 4.

7. However, Hannah did not do anything to indicate her actual thoughts about the orange's location.

8. Putting this together:

Alexander would think that Jack thinks Hannah thinks the orange is somewhere other than the blue_treasure_chest, despite Jack actually moving it there.

But Jack actually moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest, so that is his actual thought about its location.

Therefore, Alexander would think that Jack thinks Aiden thinks Hannah thinks the orange is in the blue_treasure_chest, matching Jack's actual action.

So the answer is C: blue_treasure_chest

The key points are:

- Jack actually moved the orange to the blue_treasure_chest
- Alexander would tend to trust Jack 
- Jack would not trust Hannah
- However, Hannah's actual thoughts are unclear
- So Alexander would think Jack thinks Aiden thinks Hannah thinks it's the blue_treasure_chest, matching Jack's actual action
