  Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Hannah first moved the corn to the green_bathtub and exited. (Lines 3 and 4)

2) Avery then moved the corn to the red_basket and exited. (Lines 13 and 14)  

3) Abigail finally moved the corn to the green_bucket and exited. (Lines 21 and 22)

4) Abigail was the last one to move and exit the basement. (Lines 21 and 22)

5) William exited after Abigail but did not move the corn. (Lines 23 and 24)

6) Since Abigail was the last to move and exit the basement, her move to the green_bucket is the last recorded movement of the corn.

Therefore, the corn is really in E. green_bucket. This is where Abigail, the last person to move and exit the basement, moved the corn.
