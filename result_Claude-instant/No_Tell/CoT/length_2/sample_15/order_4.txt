 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1) According to the story, Abigail was the last one to move the corn in the basement when Nathan and Hannah were not present, so Abigail knows the corn is in the green_bucket. 

2) Nathan exited the basement before Abigail, so according to assumption 4, Abigail trusts Nathan less and would not believe him if he told her otherwise. Therefore, Abigail thinks the corn is in the green_bucket.

3) Nathan does not know where Abigail moved the corn to, as he exited the basement before her. However, according to assumption 2, he can infer Abigail's thoughts since they were together in the basement and waiting_room. Therefore, Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the corn is in the green_bucket.

4) Avery exited the basement before Nathan, so according to assumption 4, Nathan trusts Avery less. Therefore,  Nathan would not tell Avery where he thinks Abigail thinks the corn is. 

5) Therefore, Avery does not know where Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the corn is.

6) Finally, Hannah exited the basement before Avery, so according to assumption 4, Hannah trusts Avery less. Therefore, Hannah would not be able to deduce where Avery thinks Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the corn is.

In summary, the answer is that Hannah thinks Avery thinks Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the corn is in option E: green_bucket.
