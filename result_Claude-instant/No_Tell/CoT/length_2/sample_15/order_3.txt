 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Avery and Nathan were never in the same place or had any interactions according to the story. So based on Assumption 2, Avery cannot infer Nathan's thoughts.

2) Avery last exited the basement in line 14, while Nathan exited in line 12. Based on Assumption 4, Avery would tend to trust his own observations over Nathan's.

3) When Avery last exited the basement in line 14, the corn was in the red_basket according to line 13, where Avery moved the corn there.

4) Therefore, Avery would think that Nathan thinks the corn is in the red_basket, based on Avery's own last observations and his tendency to trust his own observations over Nathan's (Assumptions 2, 4).

So the answer is A: red_basket
