 Okay, here is my step by step analysis of where Aiden thinks Avery thinks the cabbage is:

1) Aiden and Avery were both in the staircase together after entering the waiting room (lines 16-24).

2) While in the staircase, Aiden witnessed Avery moving the cabbage to the green_envelope (line 20).  

3) Based on assumption 1, Avery witnessed this as well since Aiden did the action before Avery exited the staircase.

4) There were no private or public communications between Aiden and Avery that would contradict what they witnessed (assumption 2).  

5) According to assumption 3, what a character tells others does not affect their actual thoughts.

6) Based on the information provided and our assumptions, Aiden and Avery both know that Avery moved the cabbage to the green_envelope based on what they witnessed.

7) Therefore, Aiden thinks that Avery thinks the cabbage is in the green_envelope, based on Avery's own actions that Aiden witnessed.

In conclusion, the answer is B. green_envelope
