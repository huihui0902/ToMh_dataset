 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts on locating the cabbage:

1. The story initially says that the cabbage is in the green_envelope in line 2.

2. Line 3 then says Noah moved the cabbage to the green_box. Since Noah was the first to exit in line 5, all the other characters would know that the cabbage was last seen by Noah in the green_box. 

3. Next, in line 20, Avery moves the cabbage to the green_envelope. Since Avery exited after Jackson in line 23, both Aiden and Jackson would know that the cabbage was last seen by Avery in the green_envelope.

4. None of the characters made any other movements with the cabbage after that point.

5. Based on Assumption 4 that agents tend to trust agents that exited later, both Aiden and Jackson would believe that the cabbage is currently in the green_envelope based on observing Avery move it there right before Avery exited.

Therefore, the cabbage is most likely in the green_envelope, so the answer is B: green_envelope.

Does that logic sound reasonable? Let me know if you have any other questions!
