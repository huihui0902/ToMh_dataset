 Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1. Noah thinks the cabbage was originally in the green_envelope (from step 2).

2. Emma exited before Aiden and Avery, so she will not know where Aiden or Avery thinks the cabbage is currently. She will just think it is still in the green_envelope based on what she witnessed. 

3. Aiden exited before Avery, so he will think the cabbage is where Avery last moved it to, the green_envelope (from step 20).

4. Therefore, Avery actually thinks the cabbage is in the green_envelope since that is where he last moved it to.

5. Putting this all together, Noah will think that Emma thinks that Aiden thinks that Avery thinks the cabbage is in the green_envelope.

So the answer is B: green_envelope
