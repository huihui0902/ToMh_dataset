    Okay, here is my reasoning step-by-step:

1) Charlotte moved the pear to the red_bucket (line 7). This shows that Charlotte actually thinks the pear is in the red_bucket.  

2) Though Avery dislikes the pear (line 17) and cabbage (line 21), according to Assumption 3 every agent tends to lie so what they say does not affect their actual thoughts.

3) Charlotte exited before all the other agents (line 8), so no one else's thoughts or actions after Charlotte exited would change where Charlotte actually thinks the pear is.

Therefore, the pear is really in:   

M. red_bucket

The key is that Charlotte's last actions before exiting, where she could still witness everything according to Assumption 1, show her actual thoughts on the pear's location. What others say or do after she exits is irrelevant.
