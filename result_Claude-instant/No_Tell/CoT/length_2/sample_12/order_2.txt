 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to the story, the pear started in the red_box.

2. Charlotte then moved the pear to the red_bucket and exited before Avery.

3. William, Ava and Alexander did not move or interact with anyone regarding the pear.

4. Based on Assumption 1, Charlotte would have witnessed the pear in the red_box before moving it.

5. Charlotte exited before Alexander, so based on Assumption 4 Alexander would tend to trust Charlotte. 

6. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Charlotte claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

7. Putting this together:

Charlotte actually moved the pear to the red_bucket and exited before Alexander. Alexander would tend to trust Charlotte. But Charlotte's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts.

Therefore, Alexander would think that Charlotte actually thinks the pear is in the red_bucket, where she moved it.

So the answer is M: red_bucket

The key points are:

- Charlotte moved the pear to the red_bucket
- Charlotte exited before Alexander, so he would tend to trust her
- However, Charlotte's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts
- Therefore, Alexander would think Charlotte's actual thoughts match where she moved the pear, the red_bucket
