  Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1) Charlotte moved the pear to the red_bucket (line 7). So Charlotte thinks the pear is in the red_bucket.  

2) Charlotte exited before Ava (line 8 vs line 6). So by Assumption 4, Ava trusts Charlotte more than herself.  

3) Ava made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute (line 5). So Ava has no information and thinks the pear is where Charlotte last put it: the red_bucket.

4) Alexander exited after William (line 12 vs line 4). So by Assumption 4, William trusts Alexander more than himself.

5) Alexander made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute (line 11). So Alexander has no information and thinks the pear is where Charlotte last put it: the red_bucket.   

Therefore, William thinks Ava thinks Alexander thinks Charlotte thinks the pear is in:   

M. red_bucket

The key was working backwards from Charlotte's perspective to determine what Ava would think based on who she trusted, then Alexander based on who he trusted, to determine what William would think they both thought.
