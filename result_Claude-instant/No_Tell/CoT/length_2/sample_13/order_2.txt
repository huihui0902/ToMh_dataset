 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Avery exited the workshop before anyone moved the watermelon. (Line 4) 

2) Avery last saw the watermelon in the blue_suitcase. (Line 2)

3) Avery did not witness anyone move the watermelon after he exited. (Assumption 1)

4) Sophia moved the watermelon to the green_envelope and exited. (Lines 5 and 6)

5) Carter moved the watermelon to the green_basket and exited. (Lines 8 and 9)

6) Carter was the last one to move and exit the workshop. (Lines 8 and 9)

7) Avery cannot infer Carter's thoughts directly since they were never in the same place after Avery exited. (Assumption 2)

8) Therefore, Avery can only think that Carter still thinks the watermelon is where Avery last saw it, in the blue_suitcase.

The answer is B. blue_suitcase.

This is where Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is, based on Avery's lack of information about Carter's actual move after Avery exited.

In summary:

- Avery last saw the watermelon in the blue_suitcase 
- He exited before anyone moved it
- Carter moved it to the green_basket after Avery exited
- Avery cannot infer Carter's thoughts directly
- So Avery thinks Carter still thinks it's in the blue_suitcase, where Avery last saw it.
