 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the watermelon started in the blue_suitcase.  

2. Sophia moved it to the green_envelope and exited before Carter.

3. Carter then moved the watermelon to the green_basket and exited last. 

4. Avery, Emily and Isla did not move or interact with anyone regarding the watermelon.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Carter would have witnessed the watermelon in the green_envelope before moving it.

6. Carter exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust him.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Carter claims does not reveal his actual thoughts.

8. Putting this together:

Carter actually moved the watermelon to the green_basket and exited last. The others would tend to trust him. But his claims are not reliable indicators of his actual thoughts.

Therefore, Carter's actual thoughts should match the location he moved the watermelon to, the green_basket.

So the answer is D: green_basket

The key points are:

- Carter moved the watermelon to the green_basket
- He exited last, so the others would tend to trust him  
- However, his claims are not reliable indicators of his actual thoughts
- Therefore, Carter's actual thoughts should match where he moved the watermelon, the green_basket
