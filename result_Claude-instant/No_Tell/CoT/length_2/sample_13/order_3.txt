 Here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1) Carter moved the watermelon to the green_basket (line 8). So Carter thinks the watermelon is in the green_basket.

2) Carter exited before Avery (line 9 vs line 4). So by Assumption 4, Avery trusts Carter more than himself.  

3) Avery made no movements and stayed in the workshop for 1 minute (line 3). So Avery has no information and thinks the watermelon is where Carter last put it: the green_basket.

4) Isla exited after Avery (line 13 vs line 12). So by Assumption 4, Avery trusts Isla more than himself.

Putting it together:

Isla thinks Avery thinks Carter thinks the watermelon is in the green_basket.

So the answer is:   

D. green_basket

The key was determining what Avery would think (based on who he trusted more and what information he had), and then what Isla would think Avery thinks (based on who Avery trusted more).

Even though Sophia moved the watermelon earlier, Carter's last move before Avery exited is what matters for determining Avery's perspective and thus what Isla thinks Avery thinks.
