 Here are the steps to determine where Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is:

1. According to the story, Evelyn moved the lemon to the red_container in line 3, then exited in line 4.

2. Isla exited before Evelyn in line 6. So she would have witnessed the lemon in the red_container.  

3. Alexander moved the lemon to the green_treasure_chest in line 7, then exited in line 8.

4. Emma moved the lemon to the green_bottle in line 9, then exited in line 10.

5. Sophia exited last in line 12. According to Assumption 1, she would have witnessed the lemon's final location as the green_bottle.

6. Lines 14 through 23 refer to movements of the pear in the TV room, separate from the hall.

7. Putting this together:

- Evelyn last saw the lemon in the red_container before she exited.

- So she thinks Isla still thinks it's in the red_container.

- She thinks Sophia witnessed it being moved to the green_bottle after Isla exited.  

Therefore, Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in:

O. red_container

Evelyn thinks Isla is unaware of any movements after she exited, so Isla still thinks the lemon is in the red_container where Evelyn last moved it.
