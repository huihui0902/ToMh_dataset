 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the lemon started in the red_box.

2. Evelyn first moved it to the red_container and exited first.

3. Alexander then moved it to the green_treasure_chest and exited before Emma.  

4. Emma finally moved it to the green_bottle and exited last.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Alexander and Emma would have witnessed the lemon's location before moving it.

6. Emma exited last, so based on Assumption 4 the others would tend to trust her.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Emma claims does not reveal its actual location. 

8. Putting this together:

Emma actually moved the lemon to the green_bottle and exited last. The others would tend to trust her. But her claims are not reliable indicators of its actual location.

Therefore, the lemon's actual location should match where Emma moved it, the green_bottle.

So the answer is K: green_bottle

The key points are:

- Emma moved the lemon to the green_bottle 
- She exited last, so the others would tend to trust her
- However, her claims are not reliable indicators of its actual location
- Therefore, the lemon's actual location should match where Emma moved it, the green_bottle
