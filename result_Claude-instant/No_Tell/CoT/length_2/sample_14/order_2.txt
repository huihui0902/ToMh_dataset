 Here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1) Emma moved the lemon to the green_bottle (line 9). So Emma thinks the lemon is in the green_bottle.  

2) Emma exited before Isla (line 10 vs line 6). So by Assumption 4, Isla trusts Emma more than herself.

3) Isla made no movements and stayed in the hall for 1 minute (line 5). So Isla has no information and thinks the lemon is where Emma last put it: the green_bottle.

4) Sophia exited after Isla (line 12 vs line 6). So by Assumption 4, Isla trusts Sophia more than herself.

Putting it together:

Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in the green_bottle.   

So the answer is:

K. green_bottle

The key was determining what Isla would think (based on who she trusted more and what information she had), and then what Sophia would think Isla thinks (based on who Isla trusted more).

Even though Evelyn and Alexander moved the lemon earlier, Emma's last move before Isla exited is what matters for determining Isla's perspective and thus what Sophia thinks Isla thinks.
