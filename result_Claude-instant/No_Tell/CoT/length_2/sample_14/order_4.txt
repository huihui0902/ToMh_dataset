  Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to the story, Emma moved the lemon to the green_bottle and exited last.

2. Isla, Evelyn and Alexander did not move or interact with anyone regarding the lemon.

3. Alexander exited after Emma, so based on Assumption 4 he would tend to trust Emma. 

4. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Emma claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

5. Emma actually moved the lemon to the green_bottle.

6. Isla exited before Evelyn, so Evelyn would tend not to trust Isla based on Assumption 4.   

7. However, Isla did not do anything to indicate her actual thoughts about the lemon's location.

8. Putting this together:

Alexander would think that Evelyn thinks that Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is somewhere other than the green_bottle, despite Emma actually moving it there.

But Emma actually moved the lemon to the green_bottle, so that is her actual thought about its location.

Therefore, Alexander would think that Evelyn thinks that Sophia thinks Isla thinks the lemon is in the green_bottle, matching Emma's actual action.

So the answer is K: green_bottle

The key points are:

- Emma actually moved the lemon to the green_bottle
- Alexander would trust Emma
- Evelyn would not trust Isla  
- But Isla's actual thoughts are unclear  
- So Alexander thinks Evelyn thinks Sophia thinks Isla thinks it's the green_bottle, matching Emma's action
