 Okay, here are the steps:

1. Initially, the tomato was in the green_bottle according to the story.

2. Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box and then exited.  

3. Carter exited after making no movements and witnessing nothing.

4. Elizabeth then moved the tomato to the blue_container and exited, so she knows its location there.

5. Hannah exited after making no movements and witnessing nothing.

6. Jacob finally exited after also making no movements and witnessing nothing.

7. Therefore, Elizabeth thinks Isabella thinks Hannah thinks Jacob still thinks the tomato is in the green_box, where Isabella left it. 

8. This is because Hannah and Jacob exited with no information about the tomato's location after Isabella moved it.

9. Elizabeth, having witnessed the tomato in the blue_container when she exited, knows more than the others.

10. But she thinks the others still think the tomato is where Isabella left it, in the green_box.

So the answer is: D. green_box

The key points are:

- Hannah and Jacob exited with no information about the tomato, so Elizabeth thinks they still think it's in the green_box 
- Elizabeth exited after the tomato was moved to the blue_container, so she knows more than the others
- But she thinks they still think the tomato is where Isabella left it, in the green_box
