  Based on the information given:

1. Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box and then exited. 

2. Carter entered and exited without moving or seeing anything move.

3. Elizabeth then moved the tomato to the blue_container and exited.

4. Hannah and Jacob entered and exited without moving or seeing anything move.

The last movement mentioned in the story was Elizabeth moving the tomato to the blue_container. No further movements are mentioned.

Given the assumptions:
1. Agents only witness movements before exiting
2. They only trust those who exited later
3. Their thoughts don't change if they lie

The agents who exited earlier (Isabella and Carter) would not know about Elizabeth's move.
Hannah and Jacob exited after Elizabeth, so they would trust that Elizabeth's move was the last one.

Based on the facts provided, the tomato is actually in:

E. blue_container

This is where Elizabeth moved the tomato to before exiting. No further movements are mentioned.

The key details I considered:

- The order of movements and exits
- What each agent likely witnessed  
- Who each agent would trust based on exit order
- Applying the assumptions about how the agents think

My final answer is: E. blue_container

Let me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to provide a more in-depth explanation.
