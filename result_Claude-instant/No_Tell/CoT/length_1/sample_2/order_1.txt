   Okay, here are the steps:

1. Initially, the tomato was in the green_bottle according to the story.

2. Isabella moved the tomato to the green_box and then exited. 

3. Carter exited after making no movements and witnessing nothing.

4. After Carter exited, Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container and then exited herself.

5. Hannah then made no movements and witnessed nothing before exiting.

6. Jacob finally exited after making no movements and witnessing nothing.

7. According to Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting. 

8. Therefore, the last known location of the tomato, witnessed by someone exiting, is the blue_container where Elizabeth moved it.

9. Since Jacob made no movements and witnessed nothing before exiting, the blue_container is the last known location to him.

So the answer is: E. blue_container

The key points are:

- Elizabeth moved the tomato to the blue_container and then exited, so she witnessed its location there 
- Jacob made no movements and witnessed nothing, so the blue_container is the last known location to him
- The last witnessed location, according to someone exiting, is where Elizabeth left the tomato
