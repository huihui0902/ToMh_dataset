  Okay, here are the step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1. Ella witnessed that the orange was initially in the red_box in step 2.

2. Before Ella exited the study, Benjamin moved the orange to the red_envelope in step 6.

3. After Ella exited, Elizabeth moved the orange back to the red_box in step 13, which Ella would have witnessed based on Assumption 1.

4. According to Assumption 2, Ella can only infer another agent's thoughts based on what she personally witnessed.

5. Ella personally witnessed Elizabeth move the orange to the red_box in step 13, before Ella exited. 

6. Therefore, based on the last location Ella witnessed the orange be moved to, she would actually think the orange is in the red_box.

Based on the above analysis, the answer is:

F. red_box
