  Okay, looking at this logically:

Where does Elizabeth think Ella thinks the orange is?

1. Elizabeth exited last, so she saw everything that happened.

2. She saw Ella make no movements and stay in the study for 1 minute.

3. Before Ella, Benjamin moved the orange to the red_envelope.

4. Then Elizabeth moved the orange back to the red_box before she exited.

Since Ella did not witness Elizabeth's last move, from Ella's perspective:

Ella would have seen Benjamin move the orange to the red_envelope, and then she made no movements. 

So from Elizabeth's perspective, thinking about what Ella would have witnessed, she would think that Ella thinks the orange is in the red_envelope, where Benjamin moved it last while Ella was still in the study.

The answer is: H. red_envelope
