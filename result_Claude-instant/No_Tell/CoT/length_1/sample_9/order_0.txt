  Okay, here is my reasoning step-by-step:

1) Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle (line 8). But Abigail exited before Owen (line 9 vs line 14).

2) Owen then moved the banana to the green_envelope (line 13) and exited last (line 14).

3) According to Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. So Owen last moved and saw the banana in the green_envelope.

4) According to Assumption 3, what an agent likes (Abigail likes the red_pantry, line 10) or sees (Owen saw a cat, line 5) does not impact their actual thoughts about the banana's location.

Therefore, the banana is really in:

G. green_envelope  

The key is tracing the last action taken before someone exited, since that indicates where they last saw the object according to Assumption 1. Owen's move to the green_envelope was the last action taken before anyone exited.
