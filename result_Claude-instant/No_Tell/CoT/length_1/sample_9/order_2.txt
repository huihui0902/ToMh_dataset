 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to Statement 2, the banana started in the green_envelope.

2. Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle and exited before Ella.

3. Owen saw a cat but did not move or interact with anyone regarding the banana.

4. Based on Assumption 1, Abigail would have witnessed the banana in the green_envelope before moving it.

5. Ella exited after Abigail, so based on Assumption 4, Ella would tend to trust Abigail. 

6. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Abigail claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

7. Putting this together:

Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle and exited before Ella. Ella would tend to trust Abigail. But Abigail's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts.

Therefore, Ella would think that Abigail actually thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle, which is where Abigail moved it.

So the answer is F: blue_bottle

The key points are:

- Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle
- Ella exited after Abigail, so she would tend to trust Abigail 
- However, Abigail's claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts
- Therefore, Ella would think Abigail's actual thoughts match where Abigail moved the banana, the blue_bottle
