 Here are the steps to determine where Abigail really thinks the banana is:

1. According to the story, the banana started in the green_envelope in line 2.

2. Elizabeth and Ava exited before any movements occurred, so they would not know where the banana is.

3. Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle in line 8, then exited in line 9.

4. According to Assumption 1, Abigail witnessed the banana in the blue_bottle before she exited. 

5. Ella exited after Abigail, so she would have witnessed the banana in the blue_bottle.  

6. Owen moved the banana to the green_envelope in line 13, then exited in line 14.

7. Assumption 3 states that agents tend to lie, so what they say does not reflect reality. We are not told what Abigail said.

8. Based purely on the events in the story and Assumption 1, Abigail last witnessed and moved the banana to the blue_bottle before she exited.

Therefore, Abigail really thinks the banana is in:

F. blue_bottle

Abigail moved the banana there and last witnessed it there, so despite later movements she thinks it is still in the blue_bottle.
