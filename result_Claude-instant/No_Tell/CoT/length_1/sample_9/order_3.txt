 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Abigail actually moved the banana to the blue_bottle and exited. (Lines 8 and 9)

2) Ella exited before Abigail, so she last saw the banana in the green_envelope. (Lines 4 and 11)

3) Elizabeth exited before everyone, so she also last saw the banana in the green_envelope. (Line 3)

4) Elizabeth can only infer Ella's thoughts through Abigail, but not directly. (Assumption 2)

5) So Elizabeth would think that Ella thinks Abigail still thinks the banana is in the green_envelope, where Ella last saw it.

The answer is: G. green_envelope

This is where Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is, based on their exit order and limited knowledge. Elizabeth and Ella are unaware that Abigail actually moved the banana to the blue_bottle.

In summary, the key points are:

1) Abigail actually moved the banana to the blue_bottle 
2) Ella last saw it in the green_envelope before exiting
3) Elizabeth exited before anyone, so she also thinks it's in the green_envelope
4) Elizabeth can only infer Ella's thoughts through Abigail, not directly
5) So Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Abigail still thinks it's in the green_envelope, where Ella last saw it.
