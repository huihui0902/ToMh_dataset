 Okay, here is my reasoning step-by-step:

1) Abigail moved the banana to the blue_bottle (line 8). So Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle.

2) Abigail exited before Ella (line 9 vs line 12). So by Assumption 4, Ella trusts Abigail more than herself.

3) Ella made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute (line 11). So Ella has no information and thinks the banana is where Abigail last put it: the blue_bottle.

4) Owen exited after Elizabeth (line 14 vs line 4). So by Assumption 4, Elizabeth trusts Owen more than herself.

5) Elizabeth made no movements and stayed in the bedroom for 1 minute (line 3). So Elizabeth has no information and thinks the banana is where it started: the green_envelope.

Putting it all together:

Owen thinks Elizabeth thinks Ella thinks Abigail thinks the banana is in the blue_bottle.

So the answer is:

F. blue_bottle

The key was working backwards from Abigail's perspective to determine what Ella would think based on who she trusted, then Elizabeth based on who she trusted, to determine what Owen would think they both thought.
