 Based on the story and assumptions, my reasoning is:

1) Avery was the first to move the lettuce, putting it in the green_bathtub (line 3).

2) Charlotte then moved the lettuce to the blue_pantry (line 6).

3) Per assumption 1, Charlotte would have witnessed Avery's move of the lettuce before she exited the living_room. 

4) No one else moved or claimed to move the lettuce after Charlotte exited.

5) Therefore, when the agents entered the waiting_room, the lettuce should still be in the blue_pantry, where Charlotte last placed it.

My answer is: L. blue_pantry
