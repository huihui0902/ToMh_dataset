 Okay, breaking this down:

Where does Owen think Charlotte thinks Avery thinks the lettuce is?

1. Owen exited the room after Charlotte and Avery. 

2. Based on assumption 1, Owen would have witnessed Charlotte move the lettuce to the blue_pantry.

3. However, Owen moved the lettuce back to the green_drawer before exiting (line 14).

4. Charlotte would have witnessed Avery's initial move of the lettuce to the green_bathtub before she exited.

5. So Owen would think that Charlotte thinks Avery thinks the lettuce is in the green_bathtub, where Avery first moved it.

My answer is: O. green_bathtub
