 Okay, here is my step by step analysis of where Nathan thinks William thinks the plum is:

1. The plum started in the red_pantry.

2. Nathan was in the pantry but made no movements and stayed for 1 minute. 

3. Evelyn then moved the plum to the green_bucket and exited.

4. William was then in the pantry but made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting.

5. According to Assumption 2, William cannot infer Evelyn's thoughts since they were not in the pantry at the same time and had no interaction.

6. So William most likely still thinks the plum is in its original location of red_pantry.

7. Nathan witnessed all of this before exiting.

8. Based on Assumption 2, Nathan can infer that:

- Evelyn moved the plum to the green_bucket 

- William does not know this and still thinks the plum is in red_pantry

9. Therefore, Nathan thinks William thinks the plum is in the:

G. red_pantry
