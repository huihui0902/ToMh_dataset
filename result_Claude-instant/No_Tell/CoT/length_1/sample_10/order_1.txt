 Okay, to figure out where William really thinks the plum is:

1. William exited the pantry after Evelyn and Nathan, but before Emily and Jacob.

2. Based on assumption 1, William would have witnessed Evelyn move the plum to the green_bucket.

3. However, Jacob moved the plum back to the red_pantry before he exited (line 14).

4. William did not witness this, since he had already exited. 

5. So based on the last known location he saw, William would really think the plum is in the green_bucket, where Evelyn moved it.

The answer is: I. green_bucket
