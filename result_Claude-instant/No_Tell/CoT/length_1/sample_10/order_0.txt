 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1. Evelyn witnessed that the plum was initially in the red_pantry in step 3. 

2. Evelyn then moved the plum to the green_bucket in step 7, before she exited the pantry. 

3. After Evelyn exited, none of the remaining agents moved the plum until Jacob moved it back to the red_pantry in step 14, before he exited.

4. Based on Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. So Evelyn would have seen Jacob move the plum to the red_pantry.

5. Therefore, logically the plum should be in the red_pantry, based on the last known location after Evelyn exited.

So the answer is:

G. red_pantry
