 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1. Evelyn witnessed that the plum was initially in the red_pantry in step 3.

2. Evelyn then moved the plum to the green_bucket in step 7, before she exited the pantry.  

3. Nathan exited the pantry before William. According to Assumption 4, Nathan will tend to trust William who exited later than him.

4. When Nathan exited, the plum's last known location was still the red_pantry. Nathan did not witness Evelyn moving the plum to the green_bucket.

5. So Nathan would think the plum is in the red_pantry, based on what he personally witnessed before exiting.

6. William did not move or interact with the plum at all. He also exited after Nathan.

7. Therefore, based on Assumptions 2 and 4, Evelyn would think Nathan thinks William thinks the plum is in the red_pantry, since that was the last location Nathan personally witnessed before exiting.

Based on the above analysis, the answer is:

G. red_pantry
