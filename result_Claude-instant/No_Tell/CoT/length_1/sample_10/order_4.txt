 Okay, breaking this down:

Where does Jacob think Evelyn thinks Nathan thinks William thinks the plum is?

1. Jacob exited last, so he saw everything that happened.

2. He saw Evelyn move the plum to the green_bucket.

3. Evelyn would have witnessed Nathan before she exited.

4. Nathan would not have witnessed anything, since he exited first.

5. William would have witnessed Evelyn move the plum to the green_bucket.

So in summary:

Jacob saw Evelyn move the plum to the green_bucket.
Evelyn saw the plum was originally in the red_pantry.  
Nathan did not witness anything.
William saw Evelyn move the plum to the green_bucket.

Therefore, Jacob would think that Evelyn thinks that Nathan thinks that William thinks the plum is in the green_bucket, where Evelyn moved it.

The answer is: I. green_bucket
