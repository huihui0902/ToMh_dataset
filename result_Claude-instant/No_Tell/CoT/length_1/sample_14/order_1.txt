 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Abigail witnessed the lime start in the green_envelope.

2. Emily then moved the lime to the blue_pantry and Jack moved it to the blue_suitcase, before Abigail exited.

3. According to Assumption 1, Abigail witnessed everything before exiting.

4. Abigail then moved the lime to the green_envelope in step 13, before she exited.

5. Based on Assumption 2, Abigail can only infer thoughts based on what she personally witnessed.

6. Abigail personally witnessed moving the lime to the green_envelope in step 13.

7. Therefore, based on the last location Abigail moved the lime to before exiting, she would actually think the lime is in the green_envelope.

The answer is:

K. green_envelope

The key was realizing that:

- Abigail witnessed the lime being moved around before she moved it 
- But she ultimately moved it to the green_envelope, so based on what she personally did, she would think it's there
- What others did before her isn't relevant to where she thinks the lime actually is
