 Here is my step by step analysis of determining where the lime really is:

1. The lime started in the green_envelope.

2. Emily moved the lime to the blue_pantry and exited.

3. Jack then moved the lime to the blue_suitcase and exited. 

4. Avery stayed in the playroom for 1 minute but did not make any movements, then exited. According to Assumption 2, Avery could not infer Jack's movements.

5. Emily's claim that she likes the green_crate after exiting does not affect the actual location of the lime.

6. Aiden then stayed in the playroom for 1 minute but did not make any movements, then exited. He also could not infer the lime's location.

7. Avery's claim that she likes the red_basket after exiting also does not affect the lime's location.  

8. Abigail finally moved the lime to the green_envelope and exited. 

9. Since Assumption 1 states that an agent witnesses everything before exiting, Abigail saw that the lime's real location is now the green_envelope.

10. Therefore, based on the events in the story and assumptions, the lime is really in:
