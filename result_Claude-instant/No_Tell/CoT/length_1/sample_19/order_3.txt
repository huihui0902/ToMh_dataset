  Okay, here are the steps:

1. According to the story, the asparagus started in the green_bottle.

2. Emily, Abigail, Amelia, Elizabeth and Hannah all made no movements and witnessed nothing before exiting.

3. Therefore, Amelia thinks Hannah thinks Emily still thinks the asparagus is in its original location of the green_bottle.

4. Since no movements were made and no actions witnessed by any of the agents, none of them have any reason to think the asparagus changed locations.

5. Emily exited first, followed by Abigail, Amelia, Elizabeth and then Hannah. But this exit order does not matter since no one witnessed anything.

6. To summarize, Amelia thinks Hannah thinks Emily thinks the asparagus is still in the green_bottle where it started, since none of them witnessed it being moved.

So the answer is: L. green_bottle

The key points are:

- The story clearly states the asparagus started in the green_bottle
- All 5 agents made no movements and witnessed nothing per the story
- Since no actions were witnessed by any of the agents, they still think the asparagus is in its original location
- Amelia is reasoning backwards from this, thinking Hannah would think the same about what Emily thinks
