 Based on the information provided:

1. All 5 agents entered the staircase and stayed for 1 minute without moving or seeing anything move. 

2. Emily exited first, followed by Abigail and Amelia.

3. When Emily exited, she did not see the asparagus move. The last place she saw it was in the:

L. green_bottle

4. Elizabeth exited after Emily, Abigail and Amelia. 

5. When Elizabeth exited, she also did not see the asparagus move. She would still think it is in the green_bottle.

6. Hannah exited last. When she exited:
- She did not see the asparagus move  
- Elizabeth, Emily, Abigail and Amelia had already exited

Given the assumptions:
1. Agents only witness things before exiting
2. They only trust those who exited later
3. They tend to lie but thoughts don't change  

Hannah would think Elizabeth still thinks the asparagus is in the green_bottle, where Emily last saw it.

Therefore, Hannah would think that Emily thinks the asparagus is in:

L. green_bottle 

The key details I considered:

- What Emily last witnessed before exiting
- Who exited before and after Emily
- Who Emily is likely to trust based on exit order
- What Hannah knows Elizabeth likely still thinks
- Applying the given assumptions

My final answer is L: green_bottle
