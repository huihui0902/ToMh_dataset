 Here is my step by step analysis of where Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the cabbage is:

1. The cabbage started in the red_container.

2. Amelia then moved the cabbage to the green_envelope and exited. 

3. Abigail then moved the cabbage to the green_crate and exited. 

4. Based on Assumption 1, Abigail witnessed the cabbage's location as green_crate before exiting.

5. Charlotte then moved the cabbage to the blue_crate and exited.

6. Carter was then in the laundry but made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting. According to Assumption 2, Carter could not infer Charlotte's movements so Carter likely still thinks the cabbage is in green_crate.

7. Nathan was then in the laundry but made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting. 

8. Based on Assumption 2, Nathan can infer that:

- Abigail moved the cabbage to green_crate

- Abigail witnessed this before exiting

9. Therefore, Nathan thinks Abigail thinks the cabbage is in:

H. green_crate
