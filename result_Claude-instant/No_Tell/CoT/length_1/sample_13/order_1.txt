 Based on the information provided, here is my logic:

1. Amelia first moved the cabbage to the green_envelope before exiting (line 3).

2. Then Abigail moved it to the green_crate before she exited (line 5).

3. Since Abigail exited after Amelia, she would have witnessed Amelia's first move per Assumption 1.

4. Charlotte then moved the cabbage to the blue_crate before exiting (line 7).  

5. Abigail did not witness this move since she had already exited.

So the last location Abigail saw the cabbage be moved to was the green_crate, where she moved it.

Therefore, Abigail would really think the cabbage is in the green_crate, where she last moved it to before exiting.

The answer is: H. green_crate
