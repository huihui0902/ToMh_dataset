 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Amelia witnessed the cabbage was originally in the red_container.

2) Amelia then moved the cabbage to the green_envelope before exiting. 

3) Abigail then moved the cabbage to the green_crate before exiting.

4) Charlotte then moved the cabbage to the blue_crate before exiting.

5) Based on Assumption 1, Charlotte witnessed everything before exiting, including the cabbage being in the blue_crate.

6) After Charlotte exited, neither Carter nor Nathan moved the cabbage.

7) Therefore, logically the cabbage should be in the last known location, which is the blue_crate according to Charlotte's witness.

So the answer is:

F. blue_crate

The key steps were:

- Figuring out the last agent to move the cabbage before exiting
- Noting that no one moved the cabbage after that, based on Assumption 1 
- Concluding that the last known location is where the cabbage actually is

Hope this breakdown helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
