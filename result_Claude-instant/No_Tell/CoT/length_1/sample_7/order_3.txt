  Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Ella actually moved the spinach to the green basket and exited first. (Lines 3 and 4)

2) Benjamin moved the spinach to the green envelope after Ella exited. (Lines 9 and 11) 

3) Emma exited after Benjamin, but did not move the spinach. (Lines 12 and 13)

4) Aiden exited after Ella but before Benjamin and Emma. (Lines 5 and 6)

5) Aiden only witnessed Ella's move to the green basket. He did not see Benjamin's move. (Assumption 1)

6) Aiden could infer Emma's thoughts through Ella, since Ella exited before Emma. (Assumption 4)

7) So Aiden would think that Ella thinks Emma thinks the spinach is in the green basket, where Ella last moved it. (Combining points 1, 5 and 6)

Therefore, the answer is H. green_basket  
This is where Aiden thinks Ella thinks Emma thinks the spinach is, based on the information Aiden has and the exit order.
