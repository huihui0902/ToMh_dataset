 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1. According to the story, the spinach started in the red_bottle.

2. Ella moved it to the green_basket and exited first. 

3. Aiden, Jack and Benjamin did not move or interact with anyone.

4. Benjamin then moved the spinach to the green_envelope and exited last.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Ella would have witnessed Benjamin move the spinach to the green_envelope.

6. Ella exited before Emma, so based on Assumption 4, Ella would not tend to trust Emma.

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Emma claims does not reveal her actual thoughts.

8. Putting this together:

Ella witnessed the spinach being moved to the green_envelope. She does not tend to trust Emma. But Emma's claims are not reliable.

Therefore, Ella would think that Emma actually thinks the spinach is in the green_envelope, which is its last known location.

So the answer is F: green_envelope

The key points are:

- Ella witnessed the spinach being moved to the green_envelope
- Ella does not tend to trust Emma since she exited first
- However, Emma's claims are not reliable according to the assumptions  
- Therefore, Ella would think Emma's actual thoughts match the last known location, the green_envelope
