  Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. According to the story, the apple was originally in the green_bathtub in line 2.

2. Hannah moved the apple to the blue_cupboard in line 3, then exited in line 4. 

3. Jack then moved the apple to the green_drawer in line 5, then exited in line 6.

4. Lily then moved the apple to the red_box in line 7, then exited in line 8.

5. Since Lily was the last to exit the closet, according to Assumption 1 she would have witnessed the apple's final location as the red_box.

6. Hannah exited before Lily, so she would not have witnessed Lily moving the apple to the red_box. Hannah would only know that when she exited, the apple was in the blue_cupboard.

7. Putting this together: Lily moved and last witnessed the apple in the red_box. So Lily thinks the apple is in the red_box. Hannah last witnessed the apple in the blue_cupboard before she exited. So Hannah thinks Lily moved the apple after she exited, but Hannah does not know where.

Therefore, Hannah thinks Lily thinks the apple is in:

N. red_box
