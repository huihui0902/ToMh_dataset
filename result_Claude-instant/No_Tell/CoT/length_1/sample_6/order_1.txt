 Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1) Lily moved the apple to the red_box (line 7). This shows that Lily actually thinks the apple is in the red_box.

2) Though Hannah says she likes the blue_drawer (line 8), and Logan says he likes the green_pantry (line 12), according to Assumption 3 every agent tends to lie so what they say does not affect their actual thoughts.

3) Lily exited before all the other agents (line 9), so no one else's thoughts or actions would change where Lily actually thinks the apple is.

Therefore, the answer is that Lily really thinks the apple is in:

E. red_box
