 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Hannah moved the apple to the blue cupboard and exited first. (Lines 3 and 4) 

2) Jack moved the apple to the green drawer after Hannah exited. (Lines 5 and 6)

3) Lily moved the apple to the red box after Jack exited. (Lines 7 and 8)  

4) Logan and Aiden exited without moving the apple. (Lines 10-14)

5) The last recorded movement of the apple was by Lily, who moved it to the red_box. (Combining 1, 2, and 3)

Therefore, the apple is really in N. red_box, based on the information given in the story.
