 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Lily actually moved the apple to the red_box. (Line 7)

2) Hannah exited before Lily, so she last saw the apple in the blue_cupboard. (Lines 3 and 4) 

3) Jack exited before Lily, so he last saw the apple in the green_drawer. (Lines 5 and 6)

4) Aiden exited after everyone. He witnessed no one's movements. (Line 13 and 14)

5) Aiden can only infer Jack's thoughts through Hannah, and Hannah's thoughts through Lily. (Assumption 2)  

6) So Aiden would think that Jack thinks Hannah thinks Lily moved the apple to the green_drawer. (Combining points 2, 3, and 5)

Therefore, the answer is:  M. green_drawer  
This is where Aiden thinks Jack thinks Hannah thinks Lily thinks the apple is, based on the information Aiden has and the exit order.
