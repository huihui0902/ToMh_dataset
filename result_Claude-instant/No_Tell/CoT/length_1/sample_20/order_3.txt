 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1. The watermelon started in the blue_cupboard.  

2. Mila moved it to the red_box and exited.  

3. Ava then moved it to the green_bottle and exited.

4. Jacob exited after Ava without witnessing anything.

5. Jacob only knows Ava exited before him.

6. Ava last moved the watermelon to the green_bottle.

7. Jacob thinks Ava last saw the watermelon in the green_bottle.

8. Emily exited last, after witnessing the watermelon moved to the blue_bathtub.

9. Based on Assumption 2, Emily cannot infer what Jacob or Ava actually think from not being in the same place.

10. Combining points 7, 8 and 9:

Emily thinks Jacob thinks Ava thinks the watermelon is:  

D. green_bottle

Since that is where Ava actually last saw the watermelon, and what Jacob thinks Ava last saw.   

The key points are:

- Ava actually last saw the watermelon in the green_bottle
- Jacob exited after Ava and thinks this  
- Emily exited last but cannot infer their actual thoughts
- She can only think Jacob thinks what Ava last saw

So the answer is D: green_bottle
