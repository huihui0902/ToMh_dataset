 Let's break this down:

Where does Ella think Mila thinks William thinks the melon is?

1. Ella exited after Mila and William.

2. Ella moved the melon to the red_bottle before she exited (line 9).

3. Mila exited first, so she did not witness any movements.

4. William exited after Ava moved the melon to the green_basket but before Ella moved it to the red_bottle.

5. So from Ella's perspective:
  
   - Mila would think the melon is where she last saw it, in the green_box.
   
   - William would think the melon is in the green_basket, where Ava moved it to before he exited.

Therefore, Ella would think that Mila thinks that William thinks the melon is in the green_basket, where Ava moved it to and William last saw it before he exited.

The answer is: F. green_basket
