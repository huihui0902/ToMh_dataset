 Based on the story, here is my reasoning:

1. Ava was the first to move the melon after it was initially in the green_box, moving it to the green_basket (line 5).

2. Ella then moved the melon to the red_bottle before she exited (line 9).

3. William exited last, so he would have witnessed Ella's last move to the red_bottle.

4. No one else claimed to move the melon after Ella.

Therefore, based on the last known location and movement, the melon is most likely really in the red_bottle, where Ella moved it to last.

The answer is I: red_bottle
