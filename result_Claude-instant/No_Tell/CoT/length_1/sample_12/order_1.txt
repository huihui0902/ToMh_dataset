  Here is my step by step analysis for determining where William really thinks the melon is:

1. The melon started in the green_box. 

2. Mila was in the garden but made no movements and then exited.

3. Ava then moved the melon to the green_basket and exited.

4. Liam was then in the garden but made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting. According to Assumption 2, Liam could not infer Ava's movements so Liam likely still thinks the melon is in the green_box.

5. Ella then moved the melon to the red_bottle and exited. 

6. Liam witnessed a mouse before exiting. This would not change his thinking about the melon's location.

7. William was then in the garden but made no movements and stayed for 1 minute before exiting.

8. According to Assumption 2, William could not infer Ella's movements so William also likely still thinks the melon is in its original location of green_box.

9. Based on the information provided, there is nothing else to suggest a change in William's belief.

10. Therefore, William really thinks the melon is in:
