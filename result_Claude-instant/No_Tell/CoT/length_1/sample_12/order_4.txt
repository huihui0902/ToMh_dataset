1. William actually thinks the melon is in the green_box. We determined this in the previous question.

2. Mila witnessed everything before exiting. Based on Assumption 2, Mila can infer that William thinks the melon is in green_box.

3. Ella witnessed everything before she exited. Based on Assumption 2, Ella can infer:

4. Ava witnessed everything before exiting. Based on Assumption 2, Ava can infer that:

- William thinks the melon is in green_box

- Mila knows this 

- Ella knows that Mila knows this

5. Therefore, Ava thinks Ella thinks Mila thinks William thinks the melon is in:
