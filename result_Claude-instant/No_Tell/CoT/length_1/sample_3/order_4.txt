 Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1) Noah moved the eggplant to the green_envelope (line 12). So Noah thinks the eggplant is in the green_envelope.

2) Hannah exited before Owen (line 9 vs line 10). So by Assumption 4, Owen trusts Hannah more than Noah.

3) Hannah moved the eggplant to the blue_cupboard (line 8). So Hannah thinks the eggplant is in the blue_cupboard.

4) Jack exited before Hannah (line 7 vs line 8). So Hannah trusts Jack more than Noah.  

5) Jack moved the eggplant to the green_bathtub (line 6). So Jack thinks the eggplant is in the green_bathtub.

Putting it all together:
Owen thinks Jack thinks Hannah thinks Noah thinks the eggplant is in the green_envelope.

So the answer is: F. green_envelope
