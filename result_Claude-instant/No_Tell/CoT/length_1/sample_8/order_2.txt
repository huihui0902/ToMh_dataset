 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Sophia actually moved the corn to the blue_suitcase and exited. (Lines 10 and 11)

2) Chloe exited before Sophia, so she did not witness Sophia's move. (Lines 7 and 9)

3) Chloe last saw the corn in the green_crate, before she exited. (Line 2) 

4) Based on Assumption 1, Chloe only witnessed things up until she exited.

5) Chloe cannot infer Sophia's thoughts directly since they were never in the same place. (Assumption 2)

6) Therefore, Chloe can only think that Sophia thinks the corn is where Chloe last saw it, in the green_crate.

The answer is: F. green_crate

This is where Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is, based on Chloe's lack of information about Sophia's actual move after Chloe exited.
