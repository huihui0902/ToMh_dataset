 Here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1) Sophia actually moved the corn to the blue_suitcase. (Line 10)

2) Chloe exited before Sophia, so she last saw the corn in the green_crate. (Lines 7 and 9)  

3) Ella exited before Chloe, so she also last saw the corn in the green_crate. (Lines 5 and 6)

4) Owen exited before everyone, so he also last saw the corn in the green_crate. (Line 4)

5) Owen can only infer Ella's thoughts through Chloe, and Chloe's thoughts through Sophia. (Assumption 2)  

6) So Owen would think that Ella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia still thinks the corn is in the green_crate, where they last saw it.

Therefore, the answer is: F. green_crate

This is where Owen thinks Ella thinks Chloe thinks Sophia thinks the corn is, based on their exit order and limited knowledge. They are not aware Sophia actually moved the corn to the blue_suitcase.
