  Here are the step-by-step thoughts to solve this problem:

1. According to Statement 2, the corn started in the green_crate.

2. Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase and exited last.

3. Owen, Ella and Chloe did not move or interact with anyone in the crawlspace.

4. Noah exited last but did not move anything.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Sophia would have witnessed the corn in the green_crate before she moved it.

6. Sophia exited last, so based on Assumption 4, the others would tend to trust her claims. 

7. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Sophia tells others does not reveal her actual thoughts.

8. Putting this together:

Sophia actually moved the corn to the blue_suitcase. She exited last, so others would tend to trust her. But her claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts.

Therefore, Sophia's actual thoughts should match the location she moved the corn to, the blue_suitcase.

So the answer is J: blue_suitcase

The key points are:

- Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase
- She exited last, so others would tend to trust her claims
- However, her claims are not reliable indicators of her actual thoughts
- Therefore, her actual thoughts should match the location she moved the corn to, the blue_suitcase
