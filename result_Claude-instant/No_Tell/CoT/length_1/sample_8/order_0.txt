 Here are the steps to solve this question:

1) According to the story, the corn started in the green_crate in line 2.

2) Owen exited first in line 4, so he would not have witnessed any movements.

3) Ella exited after Owen in line 6, so she also would not have witnessed any movements.

4) Chloe exited after Ella in line 9, so she also would not have witnessed any movements.

5) Sophia moved the corn to the blue_suitcase in line 10, then exited in line 11. According to Assumption 1, she witnessed the corn's final location as the blue_suitcase. 

6) Noah exited last in line 13. He would have witnessed Sophia move the corn to the blue_suitcase.

7) Assumption 3 states that agents tend to lie, so what they say does not reflect reality. We are not told what any agents said.

8) Therefore, based purely on the events described in the story and Assumptions 1 and 3, the corn is most likely actually in:

J. blue_suitcase

So in summary, the corn is really in the blue_suitcase. Sophia moved it there and Noah witnessed it, and no evidence contradicts this.
