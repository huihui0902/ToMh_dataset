 Okay, here are the steps:

1. Initially, the carrot was in the red_container. Isabella then moved it to the blue_container.

2. Evelyn witnessed this before exiting. 

3. William exited after Evelyn, so according to Assumption 4, Evelyn will tend to trust William more. 

4. However, William made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute, so he did not witness any actions.

5. After William exited, Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub and then exited. 

6. Logan witnessed this and then moved the carrot to the red_container before exiting himself.

7. Since Logan exited last, he will tend to trust Evelyn more according to Assumption 4.

8. Evelyn witnessed Isabella move the carrot to the blue_container, but made no movements herself.

9. So Logan thinks Evelyn saw the carrot being moved to the blue_container.

10. Evelyn, in turn, exited before William and did not interact with him. So she cannot infer his thoughts based on Assumption 2.

11. William made no movements and did not witness any actions.

12. Therefore, Logan thinks Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot could be anywhere ("green_cupboard" is a random option).

The answer is A: green_cupboard   

The key points are that William made no movements and did not witness anything.  Evelyn also did not interact with William, so she has no reason to think he knows where the carrot is. Logan is reasoning backwards from his own knowledge to what Evelyn saw, and then what Evelyn thinks William saw.

Hope this breakdown helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
