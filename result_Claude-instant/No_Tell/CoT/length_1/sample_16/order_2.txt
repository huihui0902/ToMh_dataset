 Based on the given information, here is my analysis:

1. Isabella moved the carrot to the blue_container and then exited. William witnessed this.

2. Evelyn entered and stayed for 1 minute but did not move or see anything moved.  

3. Evelyn then exited. William exited after Evelyn.

4. Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub and exited. William witnessed this.

5. Logan moved the carrot to the red_container and then exited last.

When William exited, he knew:
- The carrot was last moved to the red_container by Logan 
- Logan exited last

So William would think the carrot is in the red_container.

Evelyn exited before William. When she exited:
- She did not see the carrot moved   
- William had not yet exited

So Evelyn does not know what William witnessed after she exited.

Therefore, Evelyn would think William thinks the carrot is where it was  when she last saw it, which was:

E. blue_container

The key points I considered:

- When each agent exited and what they would have witnessed  
- Who exited before and after William  
- What William definitely knew by the time he exited
- What Evelyn did not know about the movements William witnessed after she exited
- Applying the given assumptions

Let me know if you have any other questions. My answer is:

E. blue_container
