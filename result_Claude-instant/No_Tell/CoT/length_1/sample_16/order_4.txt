  Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step-by-step reasoning for where Alexander thinks Logan thinks Evelyn thinks William thinks the carrot is:

1. William exited the cellar before Evelyn and Logan.

2. When William exited, he last saw the carrot in the red_container. He did not witness it being moved.

3. Evelyn stayed in the cellar for 1 minute but did not move or see the carrot move.

4. Evelyn then exited. At this point, she thinks William last saw the carrot in the red_container.

5. Logan exited after Evelyn. He saw the carrot moved to the blue_container and then back to the red_container.  

6. Logan therefore thinks Evelyn thinks William last saw the carrot in the red_container.

7. Alexander exited after Logan. He saw the carrot moved to the green_bathtub.

8. Based on Assumptions 2 and 3, Alexander cannot infer what the others actually think from their actions, claims or interactions he did not witness.

9. Therefore, Alexander thinks that Logan thinks that Evelyn thinks that William thinks the carrot is:

B. red_container

The key points are:
- William actually thinks the carrot is in the red_container 
- Evelyn thinks William thinks this
- Logan knows Evelyn thinks this 
- Alexander does not actually know what the others think, he can only think what Logan thinks Evelyn thinks.

So the answer is B: red_container

Let me know if you have any other questions or need me to clarify or expand on my reasoning in any way.
