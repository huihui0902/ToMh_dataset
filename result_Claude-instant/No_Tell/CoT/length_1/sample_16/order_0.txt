 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Initially, the carrot was in the red_container according to the story.

2. Isabella moved the carrot to the blue_container and then exited. 

3. Afterwards, Evelyn, William and Alexander were still in the cellar but made no movements.

4. Then, Alexander moved the carrot to the green_bathtub and exited.

5. Next, Logan moved the carrot to the red_container and exited.

6. According to Assumption 1, agents witness everything before exiting a place.

7. Therefore, Logan saw the carrot in the green_bathtub when Alexander exited, and then Logan moved it to the red_container.

8. Since Logan was the last one to exit the cellar, his action of moving the carrot to the red_container is the final known state.

9. To summarize, according to the story and assumptions, the last known location of the carrot is the red_container where Logan moved it.

So the answer is: B. red_container

The key points are:
- Logan's action of moving the carrot to the red_container happened last 
- According to Assumption 1, Logan witnessed the carrot's location before moving it there
- No other actions took place after Logan exited
