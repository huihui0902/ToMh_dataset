 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Logan exited the patio before anyone else moved the potato. (Based on exit order)

2) Logan did not witness anyone move the potato. (Based on assumption 1)  

3) Logan could not directly infer anyone else's thoughts since he was never in the same room as them after exiting. (Based on assumption 2)  

4) Therefore, Logan still thinks the potato is where he last saw it, in the green_envelope. (Based on logic and lack of information)

The answer is L. green_envelope
 This is where Logan really thinks the potato is, based on the information given. His assumption has not been corrected by witnessing anyone else's movements after he exited.
