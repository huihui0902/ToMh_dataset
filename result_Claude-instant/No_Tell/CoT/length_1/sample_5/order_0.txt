 OK, here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Logan entered and exited first, without interacting with anyone or moving anything. 

2. Statement 2 says the potato is initially in the green_envelope.

3. Based on Assumption 1, Logan would have witnessed Charlotte move the potato to the red_bottle, as stated in Statement 6.

4. Since Logan had no private or public interactions with anyone (based on the information given), no one else's thoughts could affect his view per Assumption 2.

5. As the first to exit per Assumption 4, Logan would tend not to trust those who exited after him.

6. Therefore, Logan's actual thoughts about where the potato is located should match what he witnessed, the red_bottle.

So the answer is N: red_bottle

To summarize, the key points are:

- Logan witnessed the potato being moved to the red_bottle
- He had no information that could change his view of the potato's location 
- As the first to exit, he would tend not to trust those who exited after him
- Therefore, his actual thoughts should match what he witnessed, the red_bottle

Does this analysis make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
