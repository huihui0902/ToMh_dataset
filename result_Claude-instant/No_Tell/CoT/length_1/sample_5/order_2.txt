 Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1) Charlotte moved the potato to the red_bottle (line 6). So Charlotte thinks the potato is in the red_bottle.  

2) Logan exited before Charlotte (line 5 vs line 7). So by Assumption 4, Charlotte trusts Logan more than herself.

3) Logan made no movements and stayed in the patio for 1 minute (line 4). So Logan has no information about the potato.

4) Benjamin exited after Logan (line 11 vs line 5). So by Assumption 4, Logan trusts Benjamin more than himself.

Putting it together:
Benjamin thinks Logan thinks the potato is in the green_envelope (where it started, since Logan has no information).

So the answer is: L. green_envelope
