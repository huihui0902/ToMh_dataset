 Okay, here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Based on the story, Logan witnessed Charlotte move the potato to the red_bottle.

2. Benjamin witnessed the same thing since he exited after Charlotte. 

3. Charlotte exited before Benjamin, so Benjamin would tend to trust Charlotte's claims based on Assumption 4. 

4. However, the story says agents tend to lie, so what Charlotte claims does not affect her actual thoughts.

5. Hannah exited after Benjamin, so she would tend to trust Benjamin.

6. Benjamin witnessed the potato being moved to the red_bottle, so that is what he actually thinks.

7. Therefore, Hannah would think that Benjamin thinks the potato is in the red_bottle.

8. Logan exited before Charlotte, so Charlotte would tend not to trust Logan based on Assumption 4.

9. However, Logan actually witnessed the potato being moved to the red_bottle.

10. Putting this all together:

Hannah would think that Benjamin thinks that Logan thinks the potato is in the red_bottle, based on Benjamin's actual knowledge.

So the answer is N: red_bottle

The key points are:

- Benjamin witnessed the potato being moved to the red_bottle
- Hannah would tend to trust Benjamin 
- Benjamin would not trust Charlotte's claims, but knows the actual location 
- Charlotte would not trust Logan, but Logan actually knows the location
- Therefore, Hannah would think Benjamin thinks Logan thinks it's the red_bottle
