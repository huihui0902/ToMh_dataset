 Okay, here are my thoughts step-by-step:

1. The story states that initially the watermelon was in the blue_container.

2. Avery, Owen and Ava stayed in the backyard but made no movements, so they did not witness the watermelon being moved. 

3. Ella moved the watermelon to the red_pantry. Since none of the other agents witnessed this, they cannot infer Ella's actions based on Assumption 2.

4. Amelia then moved the watermelon to the blue_container. Again, none of the other agents witnessed this, so they cannot infer Amelia's actions based on Assumption 2.

5. Based on Assumption 1, Ella and Amelia exited the backyard after witnessing the watermelon in its final location.

6. Since none of the agents actually witnessed where the watermelon ended up, they cannot be sure what the others did based on Assumptions 2 and 3 (that agents tend to lie).

7. Based on this, the most likely answer is that the watermelon ended up where Amelia last moved it:

The answer is L. blue_container

How does that sound? Let me know if you have any questions or would like me to expand on my reasoning for any of the steps.
