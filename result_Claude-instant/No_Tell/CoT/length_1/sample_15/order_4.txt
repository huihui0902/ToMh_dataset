 My analysis is as follows:

1. Avery entered and exited first. However, she did not see the watermelon moved.
2. Owen entered and exited after Avery. Amelia would think Avery trusts Owen more than herself, since he exited later.
3. Ella moved the watermelon after Avery and Owen exited. 
4. Amelia would think that Avery thinks the watermelon is where it was when she entered, which was the blue_container.
5. Ella exited after Avery and Owen. 
6. Amelia would think that Owen thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container, where Avery last saw it.
7. Therefore, Amelia would think that Ella thinks that Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is in:

H. blue_crate

My reasoning:

Avery last saw the watermelon in the blue_container when she entered. 
Owen exited after Avery, so Amelia thinks Owen believes what Avery believes - that the watermelon is in the blue_container.
Ella exited after both Avery and Owen, so Amelia thinks Ella believes what Owen believes.
Therefore, Amelia thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container.

The key points I considered:

- The exit order of the agents
- What each agent likely witnessed 
- Who each agent is likely to trust based on exit order
- Applying the assumptions about how the agents think
