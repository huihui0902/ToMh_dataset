 Okay, here are the steps:

1. Avery and Owen were both in the back yard for 1 minute but made no movements, so they did not witness any actions.

2. Avery exited before Owen. So according to Assumption 4, Owen will tend to trust Avery more.

3. However, since Avery did not witness any actions according to Assumption 1, Owen has no reason to think Avery knows where the watermelon is.

4. Ella moved the watermelon to the red_pantry after Avery and Owen had exited.

5. Ava was still in the back yard when Ella moved the watermelon but Ava made no movements and exited.

6. Amelia then moved the watermelon back to the blue_container after everyone else had exited.

7. Putting this together:

Owen thinks Avery made no movements and did not witness any actions before exiting. Therefore, Owen thinks Avery does not know where the watermelon is.

So the answer is: B. green_crate

The rationale is that Owen thinks Avery thinks the watermelon could be anywhere, so I chose a random option. The key points are that Avery did not witness any actions, so Owen has no reason to think Avery knows where the watermelon ended up.

Do these steps and explanation make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
