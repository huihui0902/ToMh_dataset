 Step by step analysis:

1. The story starts with Benjamin, Isabella, Chloe, Amelia and Sophia entering the porch. 
2. The lime is said to be in the green_bottle initially.
3. Benjamin moves the lime to the green_treasure_chest and then exits the porch.
4. Isabella moves the lime to the blue_crate and then exits the porch.
5. Chloe moves the lime to the green_envelope and then exits the porch.
6. Amelia stays in the porch for 1 minute but does not move the lime, then exits. 
7. Sophia moves the lime to the green_bottle and then exits the porch.

Based on Assumption 1, when an agent exits a place, they witness all movements before them. This means:

- Benjamin thinks the lime is in the green_treasure_chest 
- Isabella thinks the lime is in the blue_crate
- Chloe thinks the lime is in the green_envelope  
- Amelia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle (where it was initially)
- Sophia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle (where she moved it)

However, according to Assumption 3, what a character claims does not affect their actual thought. So Amelia's public claim in line 15 can be ignored.

The only relevant information we have is that Sophia privately told Benjamin the lime is in the green_bottle. Since they were in the porch together initially, by Assumption 2, Benjamin can infer Sophia's thought according to their private interaction.

In conclusion, the most likely place for the lime to actually be is option A: green_bottle.
