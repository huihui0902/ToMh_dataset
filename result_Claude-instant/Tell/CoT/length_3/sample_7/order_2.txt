 Okay, here are my deductions step-by-step:

1. Sophia and Amelia were both in the porch when the lime was moved around. So Amelia witnessed everything that happened with the lime in the porch.

2. Amelia and Sophia were then in the waiting room together after leaving the porch. Amelia publicly claimed the lime is in the green_bottle.  

3. Based on assumption 1 that agents witness everything before exiting, Sophia knows Amelia witnessed the lime being moved to the green_envelope by Chloe and green_bottle by Sophia herself. 

4. However, Amelia publicly claimed the lime is in the green_bottle. This shows Amelia is lying based on what Sophia knows.

5. Later, Sophia and Amelia were together again in the laundry with the beans. Amelia moved the beans to the red_box and exited.

6. Given assumption 2 that agents can only infer others' thoughts if they were together, and assumption 3 that what agents tell others does not affect their actual thoughts, Sophia still thinks Amelia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle based on Amelia's public claim in the waiting room.

7. Therefore, the answer is H: blue_bottle.

So the answer is H: blue_bottle
