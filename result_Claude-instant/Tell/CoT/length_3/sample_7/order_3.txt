 Step by step analysis:
1) Amelia last publicly claimed that lime is in green_bottle (line 15). Since agents tend to lie, this does not actually reflect Amelia's thought.

2) The only private communication Amelia had with anyone was with Chloe (line 41). Amelia privately told Chloe that beans is in green_pantry. Again, this may not reflect Amelia's actual thought.

3) Chloe did not witness Amelia make any movements regarding the lime. The last time they were together was in the porch (lines 1-13), before Amelia moved the lime. 

4) Since Chloe has no information from Amelia about where the lime is, Chloe thinks Amelia has no thought about where the lime is.

5) Therefore, Chloe thinks Sophia thinks Amelia thinks the lime is in <none>, i.e. option P.

So the answer is P: <none>
