 Okay, here are the steps to solving this question:

1. Amelia never moved or witnessed the movement of the lime. Her only information about the lime's location comes from what others told her.

2. Amelia publicly claimed in line 15 that the lime is in the green_bottle. However, according to assumption 3, we cannot trust what characters tell others as indicating their actual thought.

3. The only other information Amelia has is that Sophia privately told her in line 16 that the lime is in the green_bottle. Since this was a private communication, we can assume Amelia trusts this information from Sophia.

4. According to assumption 4, agents tend to trust agents that exited a room later than themselves. In this case, Sophia exited the porch after Amelia.

5. Therefore, based on the information given and assumptions, the most logical answer for where Amelia thinks the lime is would be green_bottle (Option A).

In summary, Amelia thinks the lime is in the green_bottle due to Sophia privately telling her that information after Sophia exited the porch later than Amelia.

Does this look like a reasonable solution and explanation? Let me know if you have any other questions!
