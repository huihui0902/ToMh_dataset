 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where the onion likely is:

1) The story states that initially the onion was in the green_crate (line 4).

2) All the characters then enter the master_bedroom where nothing is moved for 1 minute by each character as they exit (lines 5-14).  

3) So when they leave the master_bedroom, the onion is still in the green_crate.  

4) Then Lily enters the master_bedroom again and moves the onion to the blue_bucket (line 11).

5) Lily then publicly claims the onion is in the blue_bucket (line 16).

6) However, the assumption is that characters tend to lie, so Lily's public claim does not necessarily reflect reality.

7) Then Abigail enters the master_bedroom and moves the onion to the red_bucket (line 29).

8) Finally, Emily enters the master_bedroom and moves the onion to the green_crate (line 35) before exiting.

9) Since Emily exited the master_bedroom last, other characters would tend to trust that Emily's private claim to Jack is accurate, meaning the onion is likely in the green_crate (line B).

In summary, based on the information in the story and assumptions, the onion is likely in the green_crate (option B).
