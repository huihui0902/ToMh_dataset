 Step by step thought process:

1) Mila saw the onion in the green_crate (fact)

2) Mila, Abigail, Emily and Lily entered the master_bedroom together (fact)  

3) Mila made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute before exiting (fact)

4) Abigail moved the onion to the red_bucket, however this does not change Mila's belief that the onion is in the green_crate since she had already exited the room (facts)  

5) Lily and Emily also moved the onion after Mila had exited, so as far as Mila knows, the onion is still  in the green_crate (facts and Assumption 1)

6) Therefore, Mila thinks the onion is in the green_crate (inferred)

7) Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is in the green_crate because they were in the master_bedroom together when Mila saw the onion's original location (Assumption 2)

8) Jack was not with Mila, Abigail and Emily when Mila saw the onion, so he has no information about Mila's thoughts (fact and Assumption 2)

9) Therefore, Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is in the green_crate, but Jack has no basis to think anything about Mila's thoughts (inferred)

10) According to Assumption 3, the characters tend to lie, so their claims do not reflect their actual thoughts

11) Therefore, Emily thinks Jack thinks Abigail thinks Mila thinks the onion is in the green_crate (inferred from all previous steps)

So the answer is B: green_crate
