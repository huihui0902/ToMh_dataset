 Step by step reasoning:
1) Mila privately told Jack that the onion is in the blue_bucket (statement 17).
2) So Jack thinks Mila thinks the onion is in the blue_bucket.
3) Abigail and Mila did not have any private or public interaction. So Abigail does not know what Mila thinks.
4) However, Abigail was in the master_bedroom before Mila exited (statements 27-34). 
5) So Abigail witnessed Mila making no movements and staying in the master_bedroom for 1 minute (statement 33).
6) Based on this, Abigail infers that Mila did not see where the onion really is, since Mila did not move or exit the room.
7) Therefore, Abigail does not think Mila thinks the onion is anywhere in particular.

In summary:
Jack thinks Mila thinks the onion is in the blue_bucket.
However, Abigail does not think Mila thinks the onion is anywhere specific.

So the answer is:
B. green_crate
