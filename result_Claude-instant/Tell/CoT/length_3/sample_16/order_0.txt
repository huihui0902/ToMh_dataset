 Step-by-step reasoning:

1) The cherry was initially in the green_envelope according to statement 3.

2) Noah likes the green_envelope according to statement 4, so he has reason to believe the cherry is still there. However, agents tend to lie according to assumption 3.

3) Owen moved the cherry to the blue_bucket according to statement 5.  

4) Owen exited the front_yard before anyone else witnessed this according to the exit order.

5) Avery and Noah exited next, without witnessing where the cherry was moved to.

6) Aiden then moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard according to statement 12.

7) Ella exited last, without witnessing where the cherry was.

8) When Noah publicly claimed the cherry was in the green_envelope in statement 17, he was wrong since Aiden had already moved it to the blue_cupboard.

9) Ella privately told Noah the cherry was in the blue_bottle in statement 18, but this was incorrect information according to the story facts.

Based on the above, the cherry is really in the blue_cupboard according to statement 12.

The correct answer is: J. blue_cupboard
