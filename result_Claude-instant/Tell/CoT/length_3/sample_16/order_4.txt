 Step by step analysis:
1. Noah publicly claimed that cherry is in the green_envelope (Statement 17). So Noah thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope.

2. Ella privately told Noah that the cherry is in the blue_bottle (Statement 18). But according to Assumption 3, what a character tells others doesn't affect his/her actual thought. So Ella's thought is still unknown.

3. Aiden moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard and exited the front_yard (Statement 12,13). So Aiden thinks the cherry is in the blue_cupboard.

4. Putting it all together, Ella thinks Owen thinks Noah thinks Aiden thinks the cherry is in J. blue_cupboard.

So the answer is: J. blue_cupboard
