 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Noah publicly claimed that cherry is in the green_envelope (Statement 17). This means Owen heard Noah say this.

2. Owen exited the front_yard before Noah (Statement 6 then 11). So based on Assumption 4, Owen will tend to trust Noah more.

3. Therefore, Owen will think that Noah thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope.

4. Aiden exited the front_yard before Noah (Statement 12 then 11). So based on Assumption 4, Aiden will tend to trust Noah more.

5. Therefore, Aiden will also think that Noah thinks the cherry is in the green_envelope. 

6. Based on the above analysis, the answer is:

Owen thinks Noah thinks Aiden thinks the cherry is in the F. green_envelope

So the answer is F: green_envelope
