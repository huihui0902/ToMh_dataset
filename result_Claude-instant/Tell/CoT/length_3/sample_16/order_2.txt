 Okay, here is my step by step analysis based on the information provided:

1) Noah initially claimed the cherry is in the green_envelope in statement 17.

2) Ella privately told Noah that the cherry is in the blue_bottle in statement 18. However, according to assumption 3, that doesn't affect Noah's actual thoughts.

3) Aiden, Avery and Owen then entered the bedroom. Nothing is said about Aiden witnessing anything related to the cherry at this point.

4) After exiting the bedroom, Ella privately told Aiden that the lettuce is in the red_box in statement 39. However, that does not relate to the cherry.

5) The only relevant information Aiden would have about the cherry is what Noah claimed publicly in statement 17, that the cherry is in the green_envelope.

Therefore, based on the information provided and assumptions, the most logical answer is that:

Where does Noah think Aiden thinks the cherry is?
F. green_envelope

Does that make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
