 Okay, here are my deductions step by step:

1. Aiden witnessed Owen move the cherry to the blue_bucket when Owen exited the front_yard. (Assumption 1)
2. Aiden then moved the cherry to the blue_cupboard when he exited the front_yard. (Story 12)
3. Up to this point, Aiden has not received any information from others that would contradict his thinking that the cherry is in the blue_cupboard. (Stories 1-15)
4. After entering the waiting_room, Noah publicly claimed the cherry is in the green_envelope. (Story 17) 
5. However, Aiden would not necessarily believe Noah's claim since all agents tend to lie. (Assumption 3)
6. Ella then privately told Noah that the cherry is in the blue_bottle. (Story 18)
7. But Aiden did not witness this private interaction, so it would not affect his thinking. (Assumption 2)
8. Based on the information Aiden has at this point in the story, he would still think the cherry is in the blue_cupboard where he put it.

In summary, based on Aiden's perspective and the assumptions, there is no evidence to suggest he thinks the cherry is anywhere except the blue_cupboard where he put it. Therefore, the answer should be J: blue_cupboard.
