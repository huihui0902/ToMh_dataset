 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis to determine where Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is:

1. According to the story, Mila last moved the persimmon to the green_box (line 7).

2. Emily and Mila did not personally interact after that point in the story. They were not in the same place and did not have any private or public communication.

3. Based on Assumption 2, Emily cannot infer Mila's thought from any interaction. 

4. According to Assumption 1, Mila witnessed Emily moving the persimmon to the red_envelope before Mila exited the back_yard.

5. Based on Assumptions 1 and 4, Emily knows that when Mila last exited the back_yard, Mila knew the persimmon's location was the red_envelope.

6. Therefore, Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is in the red_envelope (option E).

In summary, the answer is E: red_envelope.

Emily thinks Mila last moved the persimmon to the green_box, but Emily also knows that when Mila exited the back_yard, Mila witnessed the persimmon's location as the red_envelope. So Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is in the red_envelope.

Does that make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
