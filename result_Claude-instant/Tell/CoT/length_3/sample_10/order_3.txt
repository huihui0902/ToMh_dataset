 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Mila last moved the persimmon to the green_box (line 7). She exited the back_yard before Emily (line 9).
2. Emily witnessed Mila moving the persimmon to the green_box (Assumption 1). 
3. Therefore, Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is in the green_box.
4. Charlotte exited the back_yard after both Mila and Emily (line 16).
5. In the waiting room, Charlotte and Emily had a private interaction (line 19).
6. According to Assumption 2, this means Charlotte can infer Emily's thoughts.
7. Therefore, Charlotte thinks Emily thinks Mila thinks the persimmon is in the green_box.

So the answer is:
C. green_box
