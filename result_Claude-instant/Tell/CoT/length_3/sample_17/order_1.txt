 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. William first saw the turnip in the green_crate (line 2).

2. William later moved the turnip to the red_bottle (line 7).  

3. Sophia then moved the turnip to the green_basket (line 20).

4. Then Benjamin moved the turnip to the green_crate (line 22).

5. William did not enter or exit the porch between these events, so up until this point, William's last knowledge is that the turnip is in the red_bottle.

6. William did not have any private or public interactions with the other agents after exiting the porch, so his belief about the turnip's location would not change.

7. Based on Assumption 4, William would tend to trust agents that exited later than him. But no one exited the porch after William.

8. Therefore, based on the information given, William would still think the turnip is in the red_bottle, option D.

So the answer is D: red_bottle
