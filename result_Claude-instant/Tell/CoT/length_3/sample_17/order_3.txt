 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Sophia and Benjamin were together in the porch at line 18. So Sophia knows Benjamin moved the turnip to the green_crate at line 22.

2. However, Sophia also knows William told her the turnip is in the red_bottle at line 16. 

3. According to assumption 4, Sophia tends to trust agents that exited later than her. So she trusts William's claim over what she saw Benjamin do.

4. Therefore, Sophia thinks the turnip is in the red_bottle.

5. Benjamin exited the porch after Sophia at line 23. So according to assumption 4, Benjamin would tend to trust Sophia's actions over his own.  

6. Sophia left the turnip in the green_basket when she exited the porch at line 21.

7. Therefore, Benjamin thinks the turnip is in the green_basket, according to his tendency to trust later exits.

8. Putting this together, Sophia thinks Benjamin thinks the turnip is in the green_basket.

So the answer is A: green_basket
