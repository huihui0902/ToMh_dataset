 Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1) Initially, the turnip is in the green_crate (Statement 2).

2) Sophia moved the turnip to the green_basket before exiting the porch (Statements 20-21). 

3) Then Benjamin moved the turnip to the green_crate before exiting the porch (Statements 22-23).

4) Hannah made no movements so she did not move the turnip (Statement 24).

5) When Sophia, Benjamin and Hannah entered the waiting room, the turnip was last seen by Benjamin in the green_crate (Statements 18-26).

6) Liam told Hannah that the turnip is in the green_crate (Statement 17). However, Liam did not actually see where the turnip was moved to after he exited the porch earlier (Statements 5-6).

7) William told Sophia that the turnip is in the red_bottle (Statement 16). But William is likely lying since he exited the porch before the turnip was moved around (Statements 7-8).

Based on the above, the most likely and last known location of the turnip is where Benjamin left it - in the green_crate.

So my final answer would be:

B. green_crate
