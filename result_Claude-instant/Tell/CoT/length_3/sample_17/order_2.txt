 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Benjamin and William were only in the porch together initially when the turnip was in the green_crate. 

2. Then, William moved the turnip to the red_bottle while in the porch, but Benjamin did not see this since he stayed for 1 minute and exited.

3. Later, William and Benjamin entered the waiting_room together, but they did not communicate about the turnip.

4. Then, Benjamin, Sophia and Hannah entered the porch. The turnip was in the red_bottle at this time.

5. Benjamin then moved the turnip to the green_crate while in the porch.

6. Based on assumptions 1 and 2, Benjamin would not be able to infer where William thinks the turnip is based solely on their time together in the porch and waiting_room, since they did not communicate privately or publicly.

Therefore, the answer is D: red_bottle. That is where William last moved the turnip while in the porch with Benjamin, and Benjamin has no information to suggest that William's thought on the turnip's location has changed since then.
