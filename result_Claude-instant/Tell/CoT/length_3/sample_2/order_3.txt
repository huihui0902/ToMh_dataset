 Okay, here are the step by step deductions:

1. Owen thinks the melon is in the green_envelope based on Step 7.
2. Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue_suitcase based on Step 11 and Assumption 1 that he witnessed everything before exiting. 
3. Ella and Owen were never in the same place after Step 16 when Isla told Ella the melon is in the green_treasure_chest.  
4. Ella and Aiden were never in the same place after Step 16.
5. Based on Assumption 2, Ella cannot infer Aiden's thoughts directly or from Owen.
6. Based on Assumption 4, Ella will trust Aiden more since he exited later. 
7. Therefore, Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue_suitcase (Option D).

So the answer is: D. blue_suitcase
