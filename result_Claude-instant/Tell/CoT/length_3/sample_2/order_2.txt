 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Owen and Aiden were both in the back_yard when Aiden moved the melon to the blue_suitcase (step 11). 

2) Then Owen and Aiden had no more interactions until they entered the waiting room at step 39.

3) Based on assumption 2, Owen can infer that Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue_suitcase, since they were in the back_yard together when Aiden made that move.

4) Nothing else occurred that would change Owen's inference about what Aiden thinks.

5) Therefore, the answer is D. blue_suitcase

In summary, the key facts are:
- Owen witnessed Aiden move the melon to the blue_suitcase
- Owen and Aiden had no further interactions that would change Owen's inference
- Therefore, Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue_suitcase
