 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1) The melon was initially in the blue_treasure_chest (statement 3).

2) Ella was the first to enter and exit the back_yard (statements 4 to 6). She claimed the melon was in the blue_bottle (statement 5). 

3) Owen was the next to enter and exit the back_yard (statements 7 and 8). He claimed the melon was in the green_envelope (statement 7).

4) Isla entered and exited next, but made no movements (statements 9 and 10).

5) Aiden entered and exited next, moving the melon to the blue_suitcase (statements 11 and 12).

6) Evelyn made no movements when she entered and exited (statements 13 and 14).

7) Based on assumption 4, agents tend to trust those who exited later. So Aiden's claim of the blue_suitcase is the most trustworthy at this point.

8) Subsequently, Isla privately told Ella the melon was in the green_treasure_chest (statement 16), but Ella had already exited by then so she cannot infer Isla's true thoughts.

9) Owen privately told Aiden the melon was in the blue_suitcase (statement 17), corroborating Aiden's own claim.

In summary, the most trustworthy claim is from Aiden that the melon is in the blue_suitcase (Option D).
