 Okay, here are the step by step deductions:

1) Owen thinks the melon is in the green_envelope based on his own movement in step 7. 

2) Aiden thinks the melon is in the blue_suitcase based on his own movement in step 11.

3) Aiden told Owen privately that the melon is in the blue_suitcase in step 17. So Owen thinks Aiden thinks it's in the blue_suitcase.

4) Evelyn only interacted with Aiden, who told her privately in step 41 that the banana (not the melon) is in the green_cupboard. So Evelyn has no information about where Aiden thinks the melon is.

5) Therefore, Evelyn thinks Ella thinks Owen thinks Aiden thinks the melon is in: D. blue_suitcase

So the answer is D: blue_suitcase
