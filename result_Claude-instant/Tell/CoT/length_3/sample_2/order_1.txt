 Okay, here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Aiden last moved the melon to the blue_suitcase according to step 11.

2. Aiden witnessed Isla make no movements for 1 minute in step 9 before he exited the backyard in step 12. 

3. Aiden then entered the waiting room with everyone else in step 15 and did not go back into the backyard.

4. No one directly told Aiden where the melon was after step 12.

5. Therefore, based on Aiden's own actions and observations, he must think the melon is in the blue_suitcase.

So the answer is:

D. blue_suitcase
