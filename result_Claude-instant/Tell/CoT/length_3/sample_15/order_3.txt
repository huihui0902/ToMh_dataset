 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Aiden and Sophia never entered the hallway together and had no private or public interactions. So Sophia does not know what Aiden thinks.

2. Abigail exited the hallway before Aiden. So from Aiden's perspective, Abigail's thought is based on what she witnessed before exiting the hallway.

3. When Abigail last exited the hallway in step 25, the peach was in the red_pantry according to Abigail's movements. 

4. Therefore, Aiden thinks Sophia thinks Abigail thinks the peach is in the red_pantry (option N).

In summary, the answer is:

N. red_pantry
