 Step by step reasoning:

1) According to the story, Isla moved the peach to the red_bucket in step 12. This means the peach was in the red_bucket after Isla exited the hallway.

2) No one else moved the peach from the red_bucket after Isla exited. So the peach remained in the red_bucket.

3) Assumption 1 states that agents witness everything before exiting a place. Since no one moved the peach after Isla exited, Isla would have witnessed it remaining in the red_bucket when she exited.

4) Therefore, based on the information provided, the peach is really in the red_bucket.

The answer is: L. red_bucket
