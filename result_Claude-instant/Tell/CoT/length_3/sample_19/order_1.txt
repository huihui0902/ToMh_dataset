 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my reasoning:

1) William publicly claimed in line 16 that the cherry is in the blue_container. However, according to assumption 3, public claims cannot be trusted.

2) Amelia privately told William in line 17 that the cherry is in the green_pantry. According to assumption 2, William can infer Amelia's thought since they privately interacted.

3) After that, William made no movements in the cellar in line 24. This suggests he did not witness any changes himself.

4) According to assumption 4, William trusts Amelia more since she exited the cellar later than him.

Based on these facts, the most likely option for where William thinks the cherry is would be:

K. green_pantry

Since Amelia privately told William the cherry is in the green_pantry, and William has no information to contradict that, he most likely believes Amelia and thinks the cherry is in the green_pantry.

Does this reasoning make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
