 Okay, here are my steps of thought:

1. Based on assumption 2, Ava can only infer William's thoughts from what they witnessed together or private/public interactions.

2. Ava and William were both in the cellar together from lines 1 to 8. But during that time, according to the story, William made no movements and Ava dislikes beans. There is no information about where they think the cherry is.   

3. In line 16, after they entered the waiting room, William publicly claimed the cherry is in the blue_container.  

4. However, according to assumption 3, public claims do not reveal actual thoughts, people tend to lie.

5. After that, Ava did not interact with or witness William again.

Given the above, Ava has no information to infer where William actually thinks the cherry is. The closest she has is William's public claim in line 16 that the cherry is in the blue_container. But based on assumption 3, Ava knows people tend to lie in public claims.

So based on the information provided, there is no definitive answer for where Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is located. We cannot conclude if she believes his public claim or not.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer is: A. green_envelope, meaning there is no sufficient information to determine Ava's inference of William's thoughts.
