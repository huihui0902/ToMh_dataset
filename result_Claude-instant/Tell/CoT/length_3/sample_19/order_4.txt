 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1) William publicly claimed that cherry is in the blue_container (line 16). So Ava knows William thinks cherry is in blue_container.

2) Ava publicly claimed that cherry is in the green_basket (line 38). So William knows Ava thinks cherry is in green_basket.

3) Putting this together, Amelia knows Logan thinks that William thinks that Ava thinks cherry is in green_basket, based on Logan's private claim to her on line 39.

So the answer is N. green_basket
