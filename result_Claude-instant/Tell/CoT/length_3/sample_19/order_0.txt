 Based on the story and assumptions provided, here is my logical step-by-step reasoning for where the cherry really is:

1) The cherry starts in the blue_container (line 2).

2) Logan moves the cherry to the green_bucket (line 10). He is the first one to make a change in location for the cherry.

3) Amelia then moves the cherry to the green_basket (line 22). 

4) Ava then moves the cherry to the green_bucket (line 33).

5) Finally, Amelia moves the cherry to the blue_container (line 35).

Based on Assumption 1, each agent witnesses the location of the cherry before exiting the cellar. And based on Assumption 2, agents can only infer another agent's thoughts if they were in the same place or had private/public interactions.

Since no further moves or communications are mentioned after line 35, when Amelia moves the cherry back to the blue_container, the cherry's last and true location is:

L. blue_container
