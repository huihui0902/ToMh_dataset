 Based on the story and assumptions given, here is my step by step analysis of where Logan thinks Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is:

1. William publicly claimed that cherry is in the blue_container (line 16). So Logan knows that William thinks the cherry is in the blue_container.

2. Amelia privately told William that the cherry is in the green_pantry (line 17). But according to assumption 3, agent's thoughts are not affected by what others tell them. So we can infer that William still thinks the cherry is in the blue_container.

3. Ava was not present when William publicly claimed the cherry is in the blue_container (line 16). So according to assumption 2, Ava cannot infer William's thoughts from that public claim.

4. Ava also did not have any private or public interactions with William after line 16.

5. Therefore, Ava has no information to determine where William thinks the cherry is. She has to make an assumption.

6. According to assumption 4, agents tend to trust agents that exited the room later. 

7. Ava exited the cellar later than William in line 14.

8. Therefore, Ava will likely assume that William thinks the cherry is wherever she thinks it is, which is in the green_basket according to her public claim in line 38.

In conclusion, Logan knows that William actually thinks the cherry is in the blue_container. But Logan will infer that Ava thinks William thinks the cherry is in the green_basket, since Ava has no information about William's actual thoughts and is likely making an assumption based on exit order.

So the answer is N: green_basket
