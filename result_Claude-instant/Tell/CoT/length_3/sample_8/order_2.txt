 Okay, here are the step by step inference to find where Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is:

1. Amelia and Chloe were together in the closet on two occasions (lines 29-39 and 20-27).

2. When Amelia and Chloe were in the closet together the first time (lines 29-39), Chloe made no movements and stayed for 1 minute after Amelia exited (lines 31-32). 

3. Based on assumption (4), Amelia would think Chloe trusts her more since Chloe exited after her.

4. However, Amelia also tends to lie based on assumption (3). 

5. When they were in the closet the second time (lines 20-27), Chloe again made no movements and exited after Amelia (lines 22-23).

6. The only place Chloe saw the carrot was in the green_box when she moved it there (line 11).

7. Putting all this together, Amelia would think that Chloe thinks the carrot is in the green_box, since:

- Chloe never saw the carrot moved anywhere else  
- Chloe trusts Amelia more since she exited after Amelia both times  
- However, Amelia also tends to lie so Chloe's trust in her is meaningless
- The last place Chloe remembers seeing the carrot is in the green_box when she moved it there.

So the answer is: N. green_box
