 Okay, here are the step-by-step thoughts:

1) Avery and Amelia were only in the garage together. Avery witnessed Amelia do nothing for 1 min before exiting. 

2) Amelia likely did not infer anything about where Chloe thinks the carrot is, since Amelia and Chloe never interacted.

3) Therefore, Avery thinks Amelia thinks the carrot is wherever Amelia initially thought - which is unknown. 

4) Without more information, we cannot determine where Avery thinks Amelia thinks Chloe thinks the carrot is.

So the most logical answer given the information provided is: E. None of the above.
