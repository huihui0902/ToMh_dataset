 Okay, here is my analysis step by step:

1) Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box. This means Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_box.

2) Hannah and Jackson did not enter the front yard when Sophia moved the sweet potato, so they cannot infer Sophia's thoughts.  

3) Avery did not interact with Sophia, Jackson or Hannah at all regarding the sweet potato. The only thing Avery knows is that he did not move the sweet potato.

4) Hannah publicly claimed the sweet potato is in the green_bottle. But this does not reflect her actual thoughts.

5) Jackson publicly claimed the peach is in the red_container. But again, this does not reflect his actual thoughts.

6) Hannah privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_basket. But this also does not reflect Hannah's actual thoughts.

7) Therefore, Avery has no information about where Sophia thinks the sweet potato is located. He only knows he did not move it.

8) Hannah also has no information about where Avery thinks about Sophia's thoughts on the sweet potato, since they did not interact regarding this.

In summary, the answer is:

Hannah thinks Avery thinks Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet_potato is : B. green_pantry

Hannah has no information about Avery's thoughts on this matter, and Avery has no information about Sophia's thoughts. So the default assumption is that Avery thinks the sweet potato is in the green_pantry, a random location.
