 Okay, here is my step by step analysis of the situation:

1) Jackson last saw the sweet potato in the red_box according to Statement 13.

2) Jackson then exited the front_yard, so he did not see any more movements of the sweet potato (Assumption 1)

3) Jackson then entered the waiting room and heard Hannah publicly claim that the sweet potato is in the green_bottle (Statement 16). 

4) Jackson then privately told Sophia that the sweet potato is in the red_box (Statement 17).

5) Jackson then entered the front_yard with Sophia and Hannah (Statement 18). But he did not witness any movements at this time.

6) Jackson then exited the front_yard (Statement 23) and did not witness any further movements.

7) Based on the assumptions, Jackson can only infer Sophia's thoughts based on their private interaction (Assumption 2). In that interaction, Jackson told Sophia the sweet potato is in the red_box (Statement 17).

Given all this, the likely answer is:

K. red_box

Since Jackson privately told Sophia the sweet potato is in the red_box, and he has no evidence or reason to believe otherwise, he would think Sophia thinks the sweet potato is in the red_box.

How does this logic sound? Let me
