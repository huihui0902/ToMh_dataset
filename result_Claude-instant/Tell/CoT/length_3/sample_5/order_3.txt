 Here is my step-by-step analysis of the situation:

1) Avery was not present when Sophia or Jackson moved or claimed anything about the sweet potato. So Avery has no direct knowledge about where Sophia thinks the sweet potato is.

2) Avery exited the front yard before Jackson, so according to Assumption 4, Avery tends to trust Jackson more than Sophia.

3) Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet potato is in the red box. But according to Assumption 3, Jackson's claim does not necessarily reflect his actual thought. 

4) Since Avery was not there when Sophia and Jackson interacted privately about the sweet potato, Avery has no way of knowing what Jackson actually thinks Sophia thinks.

So, based on the information given and assumptions made, there is no evidence for Avery to determine where Jackson thinks Sophia thinks the sweet potato is. The answer is therefore:

P. None of the above/Insufficient information
