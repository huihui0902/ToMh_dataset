 Okay, here are my steps to solve this problem:

1. Sophia first saw the sweet_potato in the red_box in line 2. She moved it to the green_bottle in line 3.

2. Sophia then exited the front_yard in line 4. So at this point, she thinks the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle, based on her own actions.

3. Then Hannah claimed publicly in line 16 that the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle. This does not affect Sophia's thoughts since she assumes others tend to lie. 

4. Jackson then privately told Sophia in line 17 that the sweet_potato is in the red_box. However, Sophia has no reason to trust Jackson over her own observations yet.

5. When Sophia, Hannah and Jackson re-entered the front_yard in line 18, there is no mention of Sophia observing the sweet_potato's location.

6. Therefore, based on the information given and assumptions, Sophia would still think the sweet_potato is in the green_bottle where she left it.

In summary, the answer should be:

N. green_bottle

How does that sound? Let me know if you have any other questions!
