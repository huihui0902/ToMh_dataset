 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Hannah publicly claimed that sweet_potato is in the green_bottle when they were in the waiting_room after exiting the front_yard.

2) Jackson privately told Sophia that the sweet_potato is in the red_box when they were in the waiting_room after exiting the front_yard. 

3) Sophia, Hannah and Jackson then went back to the front_yard. 

4) Based on Assumption 2, Hannah and Sophia can potentially infer each other's thoughts, but Jackson privately told Sophia where the sweet potato is.

5) Sophia moved the orange after Jackson and Hannah, so based on Assumption 4, Sophia would trust Jackson more and assume the sweet_potato is in the red_box as Jackson told her privately.

Therefore, the answer is:

K. red_box
