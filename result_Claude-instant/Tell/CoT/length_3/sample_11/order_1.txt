 Step by Step Reasoning:
1. Abigail entered the sunroom where the spinach was originally placed in the green_pantry. However, she dislikes spinach.

2. Isla moved the spinach to the green_pantry, but Abigail did not witness this as she had already exited the sunroom. (Assumption 1)

3. Abigail then entered the patio but there was no mention of spinach there. 

4. Abigail then entered the waiting room with Jack and Isla, but there were no public claims or private conversations about spinach. (Assumption 5)

5. In summary, the last thing Abigail knew was that the spinach was in the green_pantry when she first entered the sunroom. She did not witness Isla moving it.

Based on this reasoning, the answer should be:

F. green_pantry 

The last place Abigail knew the spinach to be was in the green_pantry when she first entered the sunroom. Nothing since then contradicted this.
