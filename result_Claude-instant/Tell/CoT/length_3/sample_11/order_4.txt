 Here are the step by step deductions:

1) Abigail thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry (stated in story)

2) Benjamin never entered the green_pantry, so he does not have a reason to think Abigail thinks differently. Therefore, Benjamin thinks Abigail thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry.

3) Jack only entered places with Abigail after the spinach was mentioned. He did not have any private or public interactions with Abigail. Therefore, Jack has no reason to think Benjamin thinks differently. So Jack thinks Benjamin thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry.  

4) Amelia only entered places with Jack after the spinach was mentioned. She did not have any private or public interactions with Jack. Therefore, Amelia has no reason to think Jack thinks differently. So Amelia thinks Jack thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry.

Therefore, the answer is F: green_pantry
