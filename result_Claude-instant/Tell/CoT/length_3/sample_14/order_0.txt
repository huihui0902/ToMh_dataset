 Step by step reasoning:
1) According to statement 29, the carrot was last confirmed to be in the red_envelope before anyone entered the front_yard again in statement 28.

2) Emma moved the carrot to the red_drawer in statement 30 before exiting the front_yard. However, Abigail and Avery stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute after Emma exited, so they would have witnessed this and known the carrot's true location.

3) When Abigail and Avery exited the front_yard in statements 32 and 34, they would have known the carrot was actually in the red_drawer, not the red_envelope as last stated. 

4) Then, Isabella moved the carrot to the green_crate in statement 36 before exiting. 

5) When all agents entered the waiting_room in statement 38, each would have known the carrot was actually in the green_crate based on the assumptions:
 - They witnessed all movements before exiting a place (assumption 1)
 - They were all in the front_yard together when Isabella moved the carrot (statements 28 and 36)

In conclusion, based on the reasoning and assumptions provided, the carrot is really in:

M. green_crate
