 Step by step reasoning:
1. Abigail thinks the carrot is in the red_envelope according to line 17 where she privately told Nathan that.

2. Nathan has no information to deduce where Avery thinks the carrot is. Since they never were in the same place or had private/public interactions based on the story.

3. Isabella thinks Abigail thinks the carrot is in the red_envelope. This is because Isabella and Abigail were together in the front_yard, waiting_room and lounge. So Isabella could see Abigail tell Nathan that in line 17.

4. Therefore, the answer is L: red_envelope
