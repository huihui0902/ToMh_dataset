 Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Mila stayed in the sunroom until after Owen exited. So she did not witness Owen moving the turnip to the blue_cupboard in step 7.

2. Mila did not interact with Owen at any point after exiting the sunroom. 

3. Based on assumption 2, this means Mila has no information on what Owen thinks about the turnip's location.

4. Therefore, Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is still in its original location, the green_pantry (option F).

So the answer is: F. green_pantry
