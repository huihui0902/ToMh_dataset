 Okay, here is my step by step analysis of where Isla thinks Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is:

1. The turnip started in the green_pantry according to the story.

2. Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard (line 7). This was witnessed by all the agents who were already in the sunroom at that time. 

3. Avery moved the turnip to the red_envelope (line 9). Again, this was witnessed by all agents still in the sunroom.

4. After this, none of the agents made any movements related to the turnip. They only entered and exited different rooms.

5. Since Mila made no movements and did not interact with any agents, she has no reason to think the turnip is anywhere other than where she last saw it - in the red_envelope.

6. Owen knows he moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard, so that is where he thinks the turnip is.

7. Carter was not present for either of the turnip movements, so based on the information available to him, he has no reason to think the turnip is anywhere other than its original location in the green_pantry.

8. Therefore, Isla thinks that Carter thinks that Mila thinks that Owen thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard (option J).

In summary, the answer is J: blue_cupboard
