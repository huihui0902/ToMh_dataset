 F. green_pantry

Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1) According to the story, Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard in step 7. 

2) However, the assumptions state that every agent tend to lie. So Owen's claim does not necessarily match the reality.

3) The only other clue we have about the turnip's location is from Isla in step 15, who privately told Carter that the turnip is in the red_envelope.

4) However, according to assumption 2, Carter cannot infer Isla's thought unless they have been in the same place or had private/public interactions. They did not interact again after step 15.

5) Therefore, the only information we can trust with certainty is the initial location of the turnip in step 2: green_pantry.

So based on all the given information and assumptions, the turnip is most likely still in F. green_pantry.
