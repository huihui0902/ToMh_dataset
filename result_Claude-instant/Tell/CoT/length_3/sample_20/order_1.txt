 Step by step reasoning:
1) Owen moved the turnip to the blue_cupboard (line 7), so initially Owen thought the turnip was in the blue_cupboard.

2) After that, Owen exited the sunroom and did not re-enter. He also had no private or public interactions with anyone.

3) Therefore, Owen did not gain any new information that would change his initial belief that the turnip was in the blue_cupboard.

Conclusion: Owen really thinks the turnip is in the blue_cupboard.
The answer is J: blue_cupboard
