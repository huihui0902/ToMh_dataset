 Okay, here are the step by step workings:

1) Carter enters the sunroom after Mila and Owen, so he does not witness where Owen moves the turnip to. He exits before Mila.

2) In the waiting room, Avery claims turnip is in blue_pantry. This is a public statement, so Carter hears it. 

3) In the back yard, Isla tells Carter turnip is in red_envelope. But this is a private communication, so Mila does not hear it.

4) In the waiting room again, Avery tells Owen that turnip is in red_basket. But Mila does not hear this private communication.

5) Based on the assumptions, an agent can only infer another's thoughts if they have been in the same place or had private/public interactions.

6) Mila had no interaction with Owen after he moved the turnip. She only heard Avery's public claim that it is in blue_pantry.

7) Therefore, Carter thinks Mila thinks Owen thinks the turnip is in blue_pantry, based on the only public information Mila heard.

So the answer is H: blue_pantry
