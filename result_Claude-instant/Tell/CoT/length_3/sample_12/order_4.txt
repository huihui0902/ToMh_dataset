 Step by step reasoning:
1) Avery thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry according to Line 16.
2) Hannah told Isabella that the spinach is in the green_cupboard according to Line 15. But assumption 3 states that whatever a character claims may not reflect his actual thinking. So we can't conclude Isabella thinks the spinach is in the green_cupboard.
3) Nathan moved the spinach to the green_pantry according to Line 11. So Nathan thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry.
4) Putting all this together, Nathan thinks Isabella thinks Hannah thinks Avery thinks the spinach is in the green_pantry.

The answer is L: green_pantry
