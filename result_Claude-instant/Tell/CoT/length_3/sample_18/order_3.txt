 Okay, here are the steps to solve the question:

1. Aiden and Avery were never in the same place or had any private/public interactions. So Aiden has no clue what Avery thinks.

2. Carter and Avery were in the office together before Avery exited. However, there were no movements or communications between them. So Aiden does not know what Avery thinks.

3. William publicly claimed the cabbage is in the green_envelope after everyone exited the office. But the story clearly states that every agent tends to lie. So this claim does not reflect Avery's actual thought.

4. Charlotte privately told Avery the cabbage is in the green_bucket. But Aiden was not privy to this private communication. So he has no knowledge of this.

5. In summary, Aiden has no information about what Avery thinks, let alone what Carter thinks Avery thinks.

Therefore, the answer is B. blue_cupboard, since Aiden has no clue where Avery thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is located.
