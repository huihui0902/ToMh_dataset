 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts on where Avery thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is:

1. Avery and Carter were both initially in the office together, so Carter could have witnessed Avery move the cabbage to the green_crate.

2. Then Avery and Carter exited separately and entered the waiting room separately. They had no interaction at this point.

3. Then Avery, Carter and Charlotte entered the office together. But the spinach, not the cabbage, was moved around at this point.

4. Avery, Carter and Charlotte then exited the office together and entered the waiting room. Still no interaction between Avery and Carter.  

5. Then Aiden, Charlotte, Avery and William entered the office. Avery moved the cabbage to the green_crate at this point.

6. After they all exited, William privately told Carter the cabbage is in the green_crate.

7. Based on the assumptions, Carter will tend to trust William's claim since William exited the office later.

8. So putting it all together, Avery most likely thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is in option G: the green_crate, based on William telling Carter.

So my final answer is: G. green_crate
