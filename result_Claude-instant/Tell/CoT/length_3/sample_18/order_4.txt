 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1. William thinks the cabbage is in the green_crate based on what Avery publicly claimed in step 38.

2. Avery actually thinks the cabbage is in the green_crate based on what he saw and moved in step 32. 

3. Charlotte saw and knew the cabbage is in the green_bucket based on her private communication with Avery in step 15. 

4. Carter did not see where the cabbage is. He was not involved in steps related to the cabbage.

Therefore, based on the given story and assumptions, the answer is:

Where does William think Aiden thinks Avery thinks Carter thinks the cabbage is?
