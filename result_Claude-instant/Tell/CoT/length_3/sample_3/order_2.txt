 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Jackson last interacted with Jacob in the waiting room after exiting the laundry. 

2. In the laundry, Jacob made no movements and stayed for 1 minute after Jackson exited. So Jackson did not witness anything Jacob did in the laundry.

3. Jackson moved the spinach from the red drawer to the green crate in the laundry.

4. Jackson has no information about where Jacob thinks the spinach is. He did not witness or directly communicate with Jacob after Jacob entered the laundry.

5. Therefore, Jackson has no knowledge of where Jacob thinks the spinach is located. The answer is M. red_drawer.

In summary, the key points are:

- Jackson did not witness anything Jacob did in the laundry. 

- They did not privately or publicly communicate after Jacob entered the laundry.

- Jackson has no information about Jacob's thoughts on the spinach location.

- Jackson's own knowledge is that he moved the spinach to the green crate, but that does not tell him where Jacob thinks it is.

So the answer is M. red_drawer. Jackson does not actually know where Jacob thinks the spinach is located.
