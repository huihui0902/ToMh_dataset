 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Jack privately told Jacob that the spinach is in the red_drawer (line 16).  So Jacob thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer.

2) Jacob exited the laundry before Jackson (line 22 vs line 20). So per assumption 4, Jackson will trust Jacob's statement and think the spinach is in the red_drawer.

3) Jack never directly interacted with or communicated with Jackson. The only information Jack has about what Jackson thinks comes from Jacob.

4) Therefore, Jack will think that Jackson thinks that Jacob thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer.

The answer is M. red_drawer
