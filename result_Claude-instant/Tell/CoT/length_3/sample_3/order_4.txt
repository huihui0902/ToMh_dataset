 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1. According to line 15, Ella privately told Jackson that the spinach is in the red_crate. So Ella thinks the spinach is in the red_crate.

2. According to line 16, Jack privately told Jacob that the spinach is in the red_drawer. So Jack thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer. 

3. Jacob made no movements and didn't talk to anyone about the spinach. So we don't know what Jacob thinks.

4. Based on line 15, Jackson thinks the spinach is in the red_crate, as that is what Ella told him.

5. Ella only knows that Jack thinks the spinach is in the red_drawer, based on line 16. 

6. Ella does not know what Jackson thinks Jacob thinks, as they have not interacted.

7. Therefore, the answer is that Ella thinks Jack thinks Jackson thinks Jacob thinks the spinach is in red_drawer (Option B).
