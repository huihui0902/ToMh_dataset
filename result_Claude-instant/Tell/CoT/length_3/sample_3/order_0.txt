 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step analysis:

1. The spinach starts in the red_container (line 3).

2. Jackson moves it to the green_crate (line 4) and exits (line 5). So at this point it is in the green_crate. 

3. Then Jack moves it to the blue_drawer (line 6) and exits (line 7). So now it is in the blue_drawer.  

4. Ella then moves it to the red_drawer (line 8) and exits (line 9). So now it is in the red_drawer.

5. Then Jacob and Amelia exit without moving it (lines 10-13). So it remains in the red_drawer.

6. Ella tells Jackson it is in the red_crate (line 15). But this is a lie based on Assumption 3.

7. Jack tells Jacob it is in the red_drawer (line 16). This is likely true based on the story.

8. Jackson, Jacob and Ella enter the laundry and it is still in the red_drawer (line 18).

9. Jackson moves it to the green_crate (line 19) and exits (line 20). So now it is in the green_crate.

10. Jacob exits without moving it (lines 21-22). So it remains in the green_crate.

11. Ella exits without moving it (lines 24-25). So it remains in the green_crate.

In summary, based on the actual movements in the story, the spinach ended up in the green_crate after the final person exited the laundry. Therefore, the answer is:

O. green_crate
