 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my analysis:

1) From statements 16 and 41, we know Isabella and Jackson publicly claimed the orange is in the blue_bucket and red_container respectively. However, according to Assumption 3, we cannot trust their public claims.

2) The key statements are 17 and 43, where Owen privately told Hannah it's in the red_container, and Hannah privately told Isabella it's in the blue_bottle. 

3) According to Assumption 2, Owen can only infer the location from when he was in the same place as Hannah, which was during statements 28-38 where they were in the laundry together.

4) Therefore, Owen really thinks the orange is in the red_container, as he privately told Hannah in statement 17.

So the answer is B. red_container
