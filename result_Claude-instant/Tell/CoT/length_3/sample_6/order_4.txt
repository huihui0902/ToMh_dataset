 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container (Line 17). So Hannah thinks Owen thinks the orange is in the red_container.

2) Isabella made no movements before exiting the laundry after Owen, so she did not witness Owen's private statement. Therefore, Isabella does not know what Owen thinks. 

3) Jackson made no movements before exiting the laundry after Isabella, so he did not witness anything Isabella did. Therefore, Jackson does not know what Isabella thinks.

4) Jacob made no movements before exiting the laundry after Jackson, so he did not witness anything Jackson did. Therefore, Jacob does not know what Jackson thinks.

5) Therefore, Hannah thinks Jacob thinks Isabella thinks Owen thinks the orange is in the  red_container.

The answer is B: red_container
