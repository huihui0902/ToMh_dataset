 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) According to step 17, Owen privately told Hannah that the orange is in the red_container. This means Owen thinks the orange is in the red_container.

2) According to assumption 2, Isabella can infer Owen's thoughts either because they were in the same place, or had private/public interactions. 

3) Looking at the story, Isabella and Owen were only together in the lounge (steps 18-26). However, during that time there were no public claims or private interactions between them (according to the story).

4) Therefore, Isabella has no information to determine where Owen thinks the orange is located. She has no basis to assume he thinks it is in any of the given locations.

So the answer is B: red_container. Isabella has no information to determine where Owen thinks the orange is located.

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
