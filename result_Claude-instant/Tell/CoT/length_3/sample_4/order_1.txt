 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts:

1) Amelia publicly claimed the corn is in the green_bottle in line 15. However, the assumption states that agents tend to lie, so we cannot take this at face value.

2) Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope in line 16. However, they did not actually share a place, so according to assumption 2, Amelia cannot infer Abigail's true thoughts from this.

3) Amelia entered and exited the lounge without witnessing any movements related to corn in lines 17-24. Therefore she did not gain any further information about the corn there.

4) Amelia entered and exited the bedroom without witnessing any movements related to corn in lines 26-36. Therefore she did not gain any further information about the corn there either.

5) In summary, Amelia's only known statement about the corn in line 15 is regarded as a lie according to assumption 3. She did not witness any movements that would indicate the corn's true location.

Therefore, based on the information given and assumptions made, there is no good reason to believe Amelia thinks the corn is in any of the given locations. The answer is none of the above.

Does this line of reasoning make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
