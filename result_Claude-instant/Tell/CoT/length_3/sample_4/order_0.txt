 Let's break down the problem step by step:

1) The corn is initially in the green_bottle according to line 2.

2) Nathan moves the corn to the red_envelope in line 3. So at this point, the corn is in the red_envelope.

3) Lily moves the corn to the green_envelope in line 6. So now the corn is in the green_envelope. 

4) Amelia moves the corn to the green_drawer in line 8. So the corn is now in the green_drawer.

5) Alexander moves the corn to the green_box in line 10. So the corn is now in the green_box.

6) Abigail moves the corn to the green_bottle in line 12. So according to the information given, the corn is currently in the green_bottle.

Based on the assumption that agents witness everything before exiting a place, and the fact that no one moved the corn after Abigail in line 12, we can conclude that:

The corn is really in the green_bottle.

So the answer is F: green_bottle
