 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle according to her public claim in the waiting_room (line 15).

2) Abigail tells Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope (line 16). Since this is a private communication, Amelia will not change her mind.

3) Nathan exited the hallway before Amelia, so Amelia will trust her own thought that the corn is in the green_bottle.

4) Lily exited the hallway after Amelia, so she will think Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.

5) Alexander exited the hallway after Lily, so he will think Lily thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.

Therefore, the answer is F: green_bottle.
