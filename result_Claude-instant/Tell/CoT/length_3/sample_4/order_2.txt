 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Nathan and Amelia were together in the hallway when Amelia publicly claimed that the corn is in the green_bottle. However, we are told that every agent tends to lie, so Amelia's public claim cannot be trusted.

2) Nathan and Amelia were then together in the lounge. However, nothing relevant to the corn's location was mentioned or observed there.

3) Nathan and Amelia were together again in the waiting room and then later in the bedroom. But again, nothing relevant to the corn's location was mentioned or observed in these places.

4) The only relevant information we have is that Abigail privately told Amelia in the hallway that the corn is in the green_envelope. 

5) Since Nathan was not present for this private communication between Abigail and Amelia, he has no way to infer this information about Amelia's actual thoughts on the corn's location.

Therefore, based on the information given, Nathan has no evidence to indicate where Amelia thinks the corn is located. The answer should be:

P. None of the above

Let me know if this analysis makes sense and captures your reasoning. I tried to be as thorough as possible based on the details and assumptions provided.
