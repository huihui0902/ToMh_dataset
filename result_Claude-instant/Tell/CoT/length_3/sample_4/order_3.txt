 Step by step reasoning:
1) Amelia publicly claimed that corn is in the green_bottle after entering the waiting_room (Line 15).

2) Abigail privately told Amelia that the corn is in the green_envelope after entering the waiting_room (Line 16).

3) Only Amelia and Abigail entered the lounge (Line 17). Amelia did not exit or make any movements in the lounge (Line 23).

4) When Amelia, Abigail and Nathan entered the waiting_room again (Line 25), Amelia only knew that:
 - Abigail thinks the corn is in the green_envelope (from Line 16)
 - The last public claim was that corn is in the green_bottle (Line 15)

5) Nathan was not present when Abigail privately told Amelia the location of the corn (Line 16). 

6) Therefore, from Amelia's perspective, the corn could be in either the green_bottle (her original public claim) or the green_envelope (according to Abigail's private tell).

7) Lily heard Amelia's public claim that corn is in the green_bottle (Line 15). But Lily did not hear Abigail's private tell to Amelia (Line 16).

Conclusion: Lily thinks Nathan thinks Amelia thinks the corn is in the green_bottle.

The answer is F. green_bottle
