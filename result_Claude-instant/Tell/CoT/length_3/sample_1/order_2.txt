 OK, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1. Jackson entered the hallway with the other agents but did not make any movements or have any interactions.

2. Jack publicly claimed that the peas was in the blue_suitcase in the hallway. Jackson witnessed this.

3. Jack then exited the hallway. Jackson witnessed this. 

4. Jackson then exited the hallway.

5. Jackson then entered the waiting room along with all other agents.

6. In the waiting room, Emily publicly claimed that the peas was in the blue_suitcase. Jackson witnessed this.

7. Then Isabella, Emily and Logan entered the attic while Jackson remained in the waiting room.

8. Based on the assumptions, Jackson can only infer what Jack thinks from what Jack said or did while they were together in the hallway.

9. In the hallway, Jack publicly claimed that the peas was in the blue_suitcase.

10. Therefore, based on the information Jackson has, he thinks that Jack thinks the peas is in the blue_suitcase.

So the answer should be:

L. blue_suitcase
