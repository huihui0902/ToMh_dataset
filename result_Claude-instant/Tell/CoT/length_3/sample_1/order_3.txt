 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step analysis:

1. Jack thinks the peas is in the red_crate (from line 8)

2. Jackson exited the hallway before Jack, so he would trust Jack's claim that the peas is in the red_crate (Assumption 4)

3. Therefore, Jackson thinks the peas is in the red_crate

4. Logan exited the hallway after Jackson, so he would trust Jackson's claim.  

5. However, Logan and Jackson did not interact either privately or publicly after exiting the hallway, so Logan cannot infer what Jackson thinks (Assumption 2)

Therefore, the answer is B: Logan thinks Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas is in the red_basket.
