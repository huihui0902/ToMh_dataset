 Here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Jack thinks the peas is in the blue_crate based on line 6 where it says "Jack likes the blue_crate". At this point in the story, Jack has not witnessed anyone moving the peas, so this is his best knowledge of its location.

2) However, in line 8, Jack moves the peas to the red_crate, meaning he now knows the peas is in the red_crate. 

3) Jack then exits the hallway and does not enter any place again where the peas is mentioned.

4) Therefore, based on the information given, Jack thinks the peas is in the red_crate (option K).

In summary, the answer is: K. red_crate

Jack thinks the peas is in the red_crate based on line 8 where he moves the peas to the red_crate, and he does not witness any further movements of the peas after that point.
