 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solve this problem:

1) The story says the peas starts in the blue_suitcase in line 2.

2) Jack moves the peas to the red_crate in line 8 and exits the hallway. So after Jack exits, the peas should be in the red_crate.  

3) Emily then moves the peas to the green_bottle in line 10 and exits the hallway. So after Emily exits, the peas should be in the green_bottle.

4) In the waiting room, Emily publicly claims the peas is in the blue_suitcase in line 16. But based on our analysis above, we know the peas is actually in the green_bottle at this point.

5) Isabella then privately tells Logan the peas is in the green_bottle in line 17. This is correct based on our analysis.

6) No more movement or claims about the peas are mentioned.

Based on this analysis, the answer should be:

M. green_bottle

The peas started in the blue_suitcase, was moved to the red_crate by Jack, then to the green_bottle by Emily, and remained there with no more movements mentioned. Isabella correctly told Logan the peas was in the green_bottle.
