 Based on the assumptions and story, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1. The peas starts in the blue_suitcase (Statement 2)
2. Jack moves the peas to the red_crate (Statement 8) and exits the hallway (Statement 9)
3. Emily moves the peas to the green_bottle (Statement 10) and exits the hallway (Statement 11)
4. Isabella exits the hallway after staying for 1 minute and making no movements (Statement 12) 
5. Since Isabella exited after Emily, according to Assumption 4, Isabella thinks the peas is in the green_bottle where Emily put it
6. Isabella tells Logan the peas is in the green_bottle (Statement 17)
7. According to Assumption 2, Logan now thinks the peas is in the green_bottle
8. Jackson did not enter the hallway where the peas was moved around, so according to Assumption 2, he has no information about where the peas is
9. According to Assumption 4, Logan thinks Jackson thinks the peas is wherever Jack last moved it, which was the red_crate (Statements 6, 8)
10. Therefore, Isabella thinks Logan thinks Jackson thinks Jack thinks the peas is in the red_crate (Option C)

In summary, the answer is C: red_crate
