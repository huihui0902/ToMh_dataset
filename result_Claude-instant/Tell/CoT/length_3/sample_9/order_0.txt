 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my logical step by step reasoning for where the watermelon really is:

1) According to Step 18, the last time the watermelon's location was confirmed was in the blue_cupboard.

2) Agents Elizabeth, Carter, and Jacob then entered the kitchen in Step 17.  

3) According Jacob exited the kitchen first in Step 20, followed by Carter in Step 22 and Elizabeth in Step 24.

4) Based on Assumption 1, each agent would have witnessed the watermelon's location before they exited.

5) Since Jacob exited first, he is the least reliable as per Assumption 4. Elizabeth who exited last is the most reliable.

6) In Step 23, Elizabeth moved the watermelon to the blue_container before exiting.

7) Given Elizabeth's actions in Step 23 and the fact that she is considered the most reliable based on Assumption 4, the watermelon is most likely actually in the blue_container.

Based on this logical reasoning, my final answer would be:

The watermelon is really in I. blue_container
