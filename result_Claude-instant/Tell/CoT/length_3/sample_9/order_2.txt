 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step analysis of where Carter thinks Isla thinks the watermelon is:

1. Isla did not move the watermelon nor did she make any public claims about where she thinks it is.

2. Isla and Carter were only together in the kitchen initially when the watermelon started in the blue_bottle. 

3. Later, Isla privately told Elizabeth that the banana is in the red_drawer, but this does not reveal where she thinks the watermelon is.

4. Carter last moved the watermelon to the green_bucket before exiting the kitchen.

5. Since Isla made no movements and exited the kitchen before Carter, according to Assumption 4, Carter likely does not trust Isla's knowledge of where the watermelon actually is.

6. Therefore, based on the available information, Carter most likely thinks Isla still thinks the watermelon is where it was when they were last together in the kitchen, which was the blue_bottle.

So the answer is likely F. blue_bottle.
