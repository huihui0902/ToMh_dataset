 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Nathan was not present when any agent claimed or told others about the watermelon location. So he has no information about what Elizabeth thinks.

2) Elizabeth exited the kitchen before Carter, so she would trust Carter more. According to Assumption 4, agents tend to trust agents that exited later.

3) Elizabeth did not have any private or public interactions with Isla. So she has no information about what Isla thinks.

4) Therefore, Nathan would think Elizabeth thinks Carter thinks Isla thinks the watermelon is in blue_cupboard, since that is where Carter last moved the watermelon before exiting the kitchen, according to Step 7.

So the answer is: H. blue_cupboard

In summary:
Nathan -> No information about Elizabeth 
Elizabeth -> Would trust Carter  more
Elizabeth -> No information about Isla
Therefore:
Nathan thinks Elizabeth thinks Carter thinks Isla thinks watermelon is in blue_cupboard
