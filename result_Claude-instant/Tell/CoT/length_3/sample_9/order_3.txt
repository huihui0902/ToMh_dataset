 Reasoning step by step:
1) Elizabeth exited the kitchen after Carter and Isla. So based on assumption 4, she trusts Carter and Isla more than herself. 
2) When Elizabeth was in the porch, Isla told her the banana is in the red_drawer. But according to assumption 3, this doesn't actually reflect Isla's thought. 
3) The last time Isla and Carter were together in the same place was in the kitchen. At that time, Carter moved the watermelon to the green_bucket.  
4) Based on assumptions 1 and 2, Elizabeth only knows what she witnessed herself. The last thing she saw in the kitchen was that she moved the watermelon to the blue_container.
5) Combining 3) and 4), Elizabeth thinks:
   - Isla thinks the watermelon is in the green_bucket (since Isla witnessed Carter move it there)
   - Carter thinks the watermelon is in the blue_container (since that's the last place Elizabeth moved it to before she exited)
6) Therefore, the answer is:
Elizabeth thinks Carter thinks Isla thinks the watermelon is in the  I. blue_container
