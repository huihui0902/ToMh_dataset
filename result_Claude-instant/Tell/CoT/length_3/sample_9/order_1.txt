 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Isla initially entered the kitchen where the watermelon was in the blue_bottle (line 2).

2. Isla stayed in the kitchen for 1 minute (line 11) and witnessed others moving the watermelon. 

3. After Isla exited the kitchen, others moved the watermelon to different locations (lines 7, 19, 21).

4. Isla then entered the porch (line 26) where the banana was located, not the watermelon. 

5. Isla moved the banana but did not interact with the watermelon in the porch (lines 31, 32).

6. After exiting the porch, Isla did not re-enter the kitchen where the watermelon was last seen in the blue_container (line 23).

7. Isla privately told Elizabeth that the banana is in the red_drawer, not the watermelon (line 38).

Given these details, it seems Isla last saw the watermelon in the blue_bottle when she initially entered the kitchen. After that, she lost track of its location since she did not witness others moving it nor re-enter the kitchen. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

F. blue_bottle
