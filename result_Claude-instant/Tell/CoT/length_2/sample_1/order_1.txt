 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts:

1. Owen stayed in the closet for 1 minute but did not move. This means he did not witness anyone moving the persimmon.

2. When Owen exited the closet, the persimmon was in the blue_pantry according to line 2.

3. After Owen exited, Aiden moved the persimmon to the green_treasure_chest and then exited. Owen was not there to witness this.

4. Ella and Amelia moved the persimmon after Owen exited, so he did not witness those movements.

5. Owen cannot infer Aiden, Ella or Amelia's thoughts because he did not interact with them privately or publicly.

6. Owen tends to trust agents who exited later than him. But no one exited the closet after Owen.

Based on the above points, it seems Owen's last known location of the persimmon was the blue_pantry according to line 2. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

G. blue_pantry
