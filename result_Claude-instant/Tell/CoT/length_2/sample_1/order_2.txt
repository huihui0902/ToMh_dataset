 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Based on assumption 1, when an agent exits a place, they have witnessed all movements that happened before they exited. 

2. Based on assumption 2, an agent can only infer another agent's thoughts if they have been in the same place or have had private/public interactions.

3. Based on assumption 3, what a character tells others does not affect their actual thoughts. They may lie.

4. Based on assumption 4, an agent tends to trust an agent that exited later than them, so the later the exit, the more trustworthy.

5. Based on assumption 5, private communication cannot be overheard, only public claims.

6. Owen made no movements and stayed in the closet for 1 minute, then exited. He likely has no information about where the persimmon currently is.

7. Amelia was the last one to exit the closet. So Owen would likely trust Amelia's claim the most out of the agents.

8. Amelia publicly claimed the persimmon is in the blue bottle.

So based on these points, I conclude that Owen thinks the persimmon is in the blue bottle, the answer is J. blue_bottle.

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
