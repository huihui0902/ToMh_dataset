 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Owen exited the closet before Aiden, so Aiden cannot directly observe where Owen thinks the persimmon is.

2. Aiden and Owen have not interacted privately or publicly at any point, so Aiden has no information from Owen directly.

3. The only information Aiden has about where Owen thinks the persimmon is comes from what Amelia told Ella.

4. Amelia told Ella privately that the persimmon is in the red_box. 

5. Aiden cannot overhear their private communication.

6. So from Aiden's perspective, based on the information he has, the best answer is that:

Aiden thinks Amelia thinks Owen thinks the persimmon is in the red_box.

The answer is H. red_box
