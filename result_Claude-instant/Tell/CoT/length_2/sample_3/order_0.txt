 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1. The story states that the peas was initially in the red_bottle (line 2).

2. Logan, Emma, Isabella, Hannah and Chloe each made movements and exited the hallway one by one (lines 3-14). 

3. According to Assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. So each agent knew where the peas was before they exited.

4. Then all five agents entered the waiting_room (line 15). So far, none of them communicated where the peas was.

5. Then Isabella, Logan and Emma re-entered the hallway (line 16). 

6. Isabella moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest and exited (lines 17-19).

7. Then Logan moved the peas to the blue_bathtub and exited (lines 20-21).

8. Finally, Emma moved the peas to the red_pantry and exited (lines 22-23).

9. Based on Assumption 1 again, each agent knew the peas's final location before they exited the hallway.

10. When they entered the waiting_room again (line 24), Logan publicly claimed the peas was in the green_bottle (line 25). 

11. However, Emma privately told Logan that the peas was actually in the red_bottle (line 26).

Given all this, based on Assumption 2, only Isabella, Logan and Emma could infer each others' knowledge, since they were the only ones who re-entered the hallway together. Assumption 4 indicates Logan would trust Emma the most, since she exited last. And Assumption 5 means Logan alone would know Emma's private claim.

Therefore, the most likely answer is that the peas is actually in the:
B. red_pantry, based on Emma's private claim to Logan.
