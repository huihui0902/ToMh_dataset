 Ok, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Chloe exited the hallway before Hannah. Based on assumption 4, Chloe tends to trust Hannah more than herself.

2) Hannah moved the peas to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting the hallway. So Chloe knows Hannah last thought the peas was in the blue_treasure_chest.

3) Hannah witnessed Emma move the peas to the red_pantry before exiting the hallway. Based on assumption 1, Hannah knows Emma last thought the peas was in the red_pantry.

4) Therefore, Chloe thinks Hannah thinks Emma last thought the peas was in the red_pantry.

So the answer is B. red_pantry
