 Okay, here are the step-by-step inferences:

1) Emma thinks the peas is in the red_bottle. This is because she witnessed Isabella move the peas to the blue_treasure_chest (step 9), Hannah move the peas to the blue_treasure_chest (step 12), and then she herself moved the peas to the red_pantry (step 22). 

2) Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is in the red_bottle. Hannah witnessed Emma move the peas to the red_pantry before exiting (step 23), so she knows Emma thinks the peas is in the red_pantry.

3) Chloe thinks Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is in the red_bottle. Chloe exited before Hannah moved the peas (step 14), so she has no information to contradict Hannah's inference about Emma.

4) Logan thinks Chloe thinks Hannah thinks Emma thinks the peas is in the red_bottle. Logan didn't interact with or witness Chloe at all. The only information he has is Emma's public claim that the peas is in the green_bottle (step 25). But Logan tends to not fully trust others and infers from exit order (assumption 4), so he still thinks Chloe thinks the Hannah/Emma inferences are accurate.

Therefore, the answer is A: red_bottle.
