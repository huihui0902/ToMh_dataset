 Here are my step-by-step thoughts to solve this question:

1. Owen entered the staircase and witnessed Chloe moving the cherry to the green_pantry and then exiting. 

2. Then Owen moved the cherry to the green_bucket and exited the staircase. So at this point, Owen knows the cherry is in the green_bucket.

3. After that, nothing relevant happens until everyone enters the waiting_room. 

4. In the patio, Chloe moves the apple to the green_crate. But this does not tell Owen anything about the location of the cherry.

5. Ella then publicly claims that the apple is in the blue_container. But again, this does not tell Owen anything new about the cherry.  

6. Importantly, Chloe then privately tells Owen that the apple is in the green_crate. Since this is a private communication between Chloe and Owen, we can trust that Owen learned this information.

7. But nothing in the story suggests that Owen would change his mind about the location of the cherry based on Chloe's knowledge about the apple.

Putting it all together, the answer should be:

K. green_bucket

Since Owen last saw the cherry in the green_bucket and nothing in the story suggests he would change his mind about that location.
