 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Owen moved the cherry to the green_bucket according to the story. So Owen actually thinks the cherry is in the green_bucket.

2. Ella exited the staircase after Owen exited. So based on assumption 4, Ella would trust what Owen thinks. 

3. There is no evidence that Ella heard any other information that would contradict her thinking Owen thinks the cherry is in the green_bucket.

4. Therefore, the answer is B. green_basket.
