 Okay, here are the steps of my reasoning:

1) Abigail entered the staircase after everyone else and exited last after making no movements for 1 minute.

2) Based on Assumption 1, Abigail witnessed everyone else's movements before exiting. 

3) Based on Assumption 2, Abigail can only infer the thoughts of those who were in the same place or communicated privately/publicly with her.

4) Neither Ella nor Owen directly communicated with Abigail. They only made claims while Abigail was in the waiting room.

5) Based on Assumption 4, Abigail tends to trust agents that exited later than her. In this case, that would be Ella and Owen since they exited the staircase before her.

6) Therefore, Abigail will think that Ella believes whatever Owen last claimed about the cherry's location before Owen exited the staircase.

7) Based on the story, the last thing Owen did before exiting the staircase was move the cherry to the green_bucket.

So the answer is K: green_bucket

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
