 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis to solve the question:

1) Liam entered the cellar first and made no movements. He then exited the cellar.
2) Hannah entered after Liam and made no movements. She then exited the cellar.  

Since Liam and Hannah made no movements, they would not have known where the sweet potato was, which was in the red_drawer.

3) Emma then entered the cellar and made no movements. She then exited the cellar.

Like Liam and Hannah, Emma would not have known where the sweet potato was.

4) Mila then entered and moved the sweet potato from the red_drawer to the red_crate. 

So Emma would think Mila knows the sweet potato is in the red_crate.

5) Evelyn then entered and made no movements. She then exited the cellar.

So Emma would think Evelyn does not know where the sweet potato is.

6) In the waiting room, Emma would think:
   - Hannah thinks Liam does not know where the sweet potato is
   - Mila knows it is in the red_crate

7) Then in the second part, Liam, Mila and Evelyn re-entered the cellar. Liam made no movements again.

8) Mila then moved the sweet potato from the red_crate to the red_container.

9) So now Emma would think:
   - Hannah still thinks Liam does not know
   - Mila knows it is in the red_container
   - Evelyn still does not know

10) In the waiting room, Mila publicly claimed it was in the blue_container and Evelyn privately told Mila it was in the blue_suitcase. 

11) But Emma would ignore those claims since agents tend to lie.

Therefore, the answer is L: red_container
