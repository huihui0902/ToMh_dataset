 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of the situation:

1) Liam, Hannah, Emma, Mila and Evelyn entered the cellar. All 5 witnessed the sweet_potato in the red_drawer initially.

2) Liam exited first and made no movements, so he likely still thinks it's in the red_drawer. 

3) Hannah exited second and also made no movements, so she also likely still thinks it's in the red_drawer.

4) Emma exited third and also made no movements, so she also likely still thinks it's in the red_drawer.

5) Mila moved the sweet_potato to the red_crate and exited fourth. So she knows it's actually in the red_crate.

6) Evelyn exited last and made no movements, so she still likely thinks it's in the red_drawer.

7) When they reunite, only Mila actually knows the sweet_potato's true location (the red_crate).

8) In the second scene, Liam and Evelyn re-enter with Mila. They all witness it still in the red_crate.

9) Mila then moves it to the red_container, so now she knows it's actually in the red_container. 

10) Evelyn exited last again, so she likely still thinks it's in the red_crate.

11) Mila then publicly claims it's in the blue_container, which is a lie since she knows it's actually in the red_container.

12) Evelyn privately tells Mila it's in the blue_suitcase, which is also a lie.

So based on the information and assumptions, the sweet_potato is actually in the red_container (Option M).
