 OK, here are my steps to solving this question:

1. Liam entered the cellar initially with others but did not make any movements himself according to the story.  

2. The sweet_potato was initially in the red_drawer according to the story.

3. Liam then exited the cellar and did not observe anyone else's movements while he was outside.

4. Liam then re-entered the cellar with Mila and Evelyn, but again did not make any movements himself.

5. The sweet_potato had now been moved to the red_crate according to the story.  

6. Liam exited the cellar and did not observe Mila or Evelyn's movements.

7. After exiting the cellar, Mila publicly claimed the sweet_potato was in the blue_container, but according to assumption 3, Liam cannot trust her claim.

8. Evelyn then privately told Mila the sweet_potato was in the blue_suitcase, but according to assumption 2, Liam did not witness this private interaction so cannot infer Evelyn's thoughts from it.

So based on the information Liam personally witnessed, the sweet_potato was last seen by him in the red_crate when he exited the cellar the second time. Therefore, the most logical answer is that:  

Liam thinks the sweet_potato is in the red_crate (Option O)
