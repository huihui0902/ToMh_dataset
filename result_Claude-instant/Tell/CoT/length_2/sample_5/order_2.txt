 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Emma and Benjamin were only together in the workshop.

2. In the workshop, Benjamin moved the watermelon to the green_drawer (statement 4).

3. Based on assumption 1, Emma witnessed Benjamin moving the watermelon to the green_drawer before she exited.

4. After Emma exited, Benjamin still likes the blue_bottle (statement 15). This does not change Emma's knowledge that Benjamin moved the watermelon to the green_drawer.

5. Therefore, Emma thinks Benjamin thinks the watermelon is in the green_drawer. 

So the answer is H: green_drawer
