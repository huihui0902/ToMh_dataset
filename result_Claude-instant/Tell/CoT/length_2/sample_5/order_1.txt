 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts based on the story and assumptions:

1) Benjamin initially saw the watermelon was in the blue_bottle in the workshop (Lines 3 and 4).

2) Benjamin then exited the workshop without seeing anyone else move the watermelon (Line 5). 

3) After Benjamin exited, Isabella moved the watermelon to the blue_bucket (Line 6) and Emma and Charlotte also moved the watermelon. But Benjamin did not witness these movements as he had already exited (Assumption 1).

4) When Benjamin, Isabella, Emma and Charlotte entered the waiting room, none of them told each other where the watermelon was (Line 16).

5) In the lounge, Charlotte, Liam and Isabella moved the green_pepper around but Benjamin was not present to witness this (Lines 18 to 25).

6) When Charlotte, Liam and Isabella returned to the waiting room, they did not tell Benjamin where the green_pepper was (Lines 26 to 29). Isabella only told Benjamin that the green_pepper was in the red_box, but Benjamin saw the watermelon, not the green_pepper (Line 29).

7) In summary, the last place Benjamin saw the watermelon was in the blue_bottle in the workshop (Lines 3 and 4). He has no information to indicate it was moved afterwards.

So based on this reasoning, my final answer would be:

G. blue_bottle
