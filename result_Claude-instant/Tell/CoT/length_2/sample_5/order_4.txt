 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Benjamin thinks the watermelon is in the blue_bottle according to line 3. This is Benjamin's initial thought.

2. Isabella exited the workshop before Emma according to line 8. So Emma has no way of knowing Isabella's thought. 

3. Therefore, Emma thinks Benjamin thinks the watermelon is in the blue_bottle. This is Emma's initial thought.

4. Liam exited the workshop after Emma according to line 14. So Liam would trust Emma's thought over his own.

5. Thus, Liam thinks Emma thinks Benjamin thinks the watermelon is in the blue_bottle. This is Liam's initial thought.

6. Isabella exited the waiting_room before Liam according to line 26. So Liam has no way of knowing Isabella's thought.

7. Therefore, Liam thinks Isabella thinks Emma thinks Benjamin thinks the watermelon is in blue_bottle.
