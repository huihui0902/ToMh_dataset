 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Jackson witnessed Mila moving the spinach to the blue_container before he exited the kitchen. So he knows the spinach started in the green_envelope and then was moved to the blue_container.

2) Then Jackson moved the spinach to the green_envelope, but Avery was not present for that. Avery last exited the kitchen before Jackson.

3) When Avery exited the pantry, he moved the pear to the green_bucket. But Jackson was not present for that, so he does not know Avery's actual thoughts on where the pear is.

4) Jackson only knows that Avery last exited the kitchen before him, so by Assumption 4 he may tend to think Avery still thinks the spinach is in the blue_container where Avery last saw it.

Therefore, the most likely answer is that Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is in the:

B. blue_crate
