 Okay, here are my steps to solve the problem:

1. Avery entered the kitchen where the spinach started. So he knows it began in the green_envelope (fact 3).

2. Mila moved the spinach to the blue_container while Avery was still in the kitchen (fact 4). So Avery witnessed this and knows the spinach is now in the blue_container.

3. Avery then exited the kitchen and did not witness any more movements related to the spinach (facts 5 to 14).

4. Therefore, based on the facts and assumptions, Avery still thinks the spinach is in the blue_container, option L.

In summary:
Since Avery witnessed Mila moving the spinach to the blue_container and then exited the kitchen without witnessing any further movements, he still thinks the spinach is in the blue_container.

So my final answer is: L. blue_container

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
