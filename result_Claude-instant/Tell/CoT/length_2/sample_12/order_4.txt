 Here is my step-by-step analysis:

1. Nathan sees nothing related to the spinach, so he has no idea where anyone thinks the spinach is.

2. Isabella witnessed Jackson moving the spinach to the green_envelope. Based on Assumption 1, she knows this is where Jackson thinks the spinach is. 

3. Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is in the blue_container, because that is where Avery moved the spinach according to statements 4 and 5.

4. Putting this all together:
Where does Nathan think Isabella thinks Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is?

Isabella thinks Jackson thinks Avery thinks the spinach is in the blue_container.

The answer is O: blue_container
