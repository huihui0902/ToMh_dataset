 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. The spinach starts in the green_envelope (statement 3).
2. Mila moves the spinach to the blue_container (statement 4), so at this point it is in the blue_container. 
3. Mila exits the kitchen (statement 5). At this point, everyone else who entered the kitchen (statements 2, 6, 8, 10) would have witnessed that the spinach is in the blue_container.
4. Jackson then moves the spinach to the green_envelope again (statement 12).
5. Jackson exits (statement 13) and everyone enters the waiting_room (statement 14).  
6. Based on Assumption 1, everyone who entered the waiting_room would know the spinach is currently in the green_envelope.

Therefore, based on the story and assumptions provided, the spinach is most likely in the green_envelope (option L).
