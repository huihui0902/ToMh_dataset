 Okay, here are the steps to solve this puzzle:

1. According to step 11, Isla moved the lettuce to the green_pantry. So initially, the lettuce was in the green_pantry. 

2. None of the other agents moved the lettuce after Isla, so the lettuce remained in the green_pantry.

3. According to assumption 4, the agents tend to trust agents that exited later. Isla was the last agent to exit the living room.

4. There were no private or public interactions involving the location of the lettuce after Isla exited.

Therefore, the answer is A: green_pantry. The lettuce remained in the green_pantry according to Isla's movements, and the other agents have no reason to doubt Isla since she was the last to exit.
