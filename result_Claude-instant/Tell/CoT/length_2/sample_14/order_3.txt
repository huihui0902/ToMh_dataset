 Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1. Isabella thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is in the blue_pantry.
2. According to the story, the pear was originally in the blue_pantry (line 2). 
3. Nathan was the last one to exit the sunroom where the pear was (line 15).  
4. According to assumption 4, the agents tend to trust those who exited later than themselves.
5. So Amelia would think Nathan thinks the pear is where he last saw it, which was the blue_pantry. 
6. Isabella was not in the sunroom when Nathan moved or exited, so she has to rely on what Amelia tells her.
7. But according to assumption 3, the agents tend to lie. So what Amelia tells others does not reflect her actual thoughts.
8. Therefore, Isabella thinks Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is in the blue_pantry, based on the original location of the pear and Nathan being the last to exit.

The answer is L. blue_pantry
