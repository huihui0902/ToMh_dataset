 Step-by-step analysis:
1. Owen exited the sunroom after Isabella. So Owen knows Isabella spent 1 minute in the sunroom before exiting.

2. However, Owen did not witness Isabella seeing the mouse or Amelia moving the pear. So Owen does not know these facts.

3. After Isabella and Owen exited, Aiden moved the pear to the blue_suitcase. But Owen was not present to witness this.

4. When Nathan moved the pear back to the blue_pantry and exited, Owen was already gone from the sunroom. So Owen does not know this fact.

5. Owen likes the green_cupboard, but this is irrelevant to the location of the pear.

6. After entering the waiting room, nobody had any private or public interactions. So they did not share any new information at this point.

7. In the study, Nathan moved the cherry to the red_container and exited. But this is irrelevant to the location of the pear. 

8. Isabella spent 1 minute in the study before exiting, but Owen does not know this.

9. Amelia publicly claimed the cherry is in the red_envelope. But this is irrelevant to the location of the pear. 

10. Isabella privately told Amelia the cherry is in the blue_crate. But Owen does not know this.

In summary, Owen has no information about where anyone thinks the pear is. The answer is therefore C: green_bathtub, as Owen has no knowledge or assumptions to form an opinion.
