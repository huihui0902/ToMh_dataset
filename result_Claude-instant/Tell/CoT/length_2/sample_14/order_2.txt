 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts on solving this question:

1) We are told Amelia exited the sunroom in step 9, after the pear was moved to the green_bucket by her in step 8. So she last saw the pear in the green_bucket.

2) Amelia and Nathan were both in the study in step 17. 

3) Nathan moved the cherry to the red_container in step 19, then exited the study. 

4) Amelia then moved the cherry to the red_envelope in step 21, then exited the study.

5) Amelia and Nathan then entered the waiting_room in step 25. 

6) Based on assumption 2, Amelia can infer Nathan's thoughts based on being in the study together.

7) Based on assumption 4, Nathan would tend to trust Amelia more since she exited the study later.

8) The question is where Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is. Since Nathan last saw the pear when he was in the sunroom, and Amelia last saw it in the green_bucket when she left the sunroom, the most likely option for where Amelia thinks Nathan thinks the pear is would be:

G. green_cupboard

So the answer is G: green_cupboard
