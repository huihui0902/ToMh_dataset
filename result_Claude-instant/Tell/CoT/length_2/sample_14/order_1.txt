 Here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Nathan entered the sunroom where the pear was initially located in the blue_pantry (Statement 2).  

2) Nathan witnessed all movements before he exited the sunroom according to Assumption 1.  

3) The last person to move the pear while Nathan was in the sunroom was Aiden, who moved it to the blue_suitcase (Statement 10).

4) When Nathan re-entered the sunroom, the pear's location was not mentioned.

5) Based on Assumption 4, Nathan would tend to trust Aiden more since Aiden exited the sunroom later than Nathan.

Therefore, the most likely answer is that Nathan thinks the pear is in:

O. blue_suitcase
