 Here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Nathan directly moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase in line 11, so he thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.

2. William did not enter the sunroom or have any interactions with Nathan, so he does not have any information about where Nathan thinks the cherry is.

3. Ava exited the sunroom before Nathan in line 10, so based on assumption 4, she will tend to trust Nathan's thought more than her own.

4. Therefore, Ava will think that William thinks that Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase, the location Nathan directly placed the cherry.

The answer is G. blue_suitcase
