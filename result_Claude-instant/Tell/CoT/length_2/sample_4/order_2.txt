 Step by step reasoning:
1) Emma, William, Isla, Ava and Nathan entered the sunroom. All agents came in at the same time and the cherry was in the blue_suitcase.

2) Emma made no movements and stayed in the sunroom for 1 minute, then exited. William did the same. 

3) Isla moved the cherry to the red_bottle and exited. 

4) Ava moved the cherry to the green_basket and exited.

5) Nathan moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase and exited.

6) At this point, Nathan last moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase. However, no agent witnessed this since they had all exited already.

7) Then William saw a cat. This does not affect where he thinks the cherry is.

8) According to Assumption 4, agents tend to trust agents that exited later. However, in this case no agent witnessed where the cherry ended up.

9) Therefore, based on the information given, William does not have enough information to determine where Nathan thinks the cherry is.

The answer is therefore: G. None of the above
