 Okay, here is my step-by-step reasoning:

1. Nathan entered the sunroom with the others. The cherry was originally in the blue_suitcase (fact #2).

2. Emma stayed still for 1 minute then exited (fact #3, #4). Nathan did not witness her move the cherry.

3. William stayed still for 1 minute then exited (fact #5, #6). Nathan did not witness him move the cherry.

4. Isla moved the cherry to the red_bottle then exited (fact #7, #8). Nathan witnessed Isla move the cherry.

5. Ava moved the cherry to the green_basket then exited (fact #9, #10). Nathan witnessed Ava move the cherry.  

6. Nathan then moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase (fact #11).

7. Based on the facts and assumptions, Nathan last saw and handled the cherry in the blue_suitcase, when he himself moved it there in fact #11.

8. Therefore, the answer should be G. blue_suitcase, where Nathan thinks the cherry is currently located.

So the answer is likely: G. blue_suitcase
