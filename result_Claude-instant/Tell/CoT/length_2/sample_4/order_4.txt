 Okay, here is my step-by-step thought process to solve this question:

1. Nathan last moved the cherry to the blue_suitcase in line 11. So Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.

2. William only saw a cat in line 12, he did not witness any movement of the cherry. The last person he trusts is Nathan who exited after him. So William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in the blue_suitcase.

3. Ava exited before William, so she does not know what William thinks. The last person she witnessed moving the cherry was herself in line 9, to the green_basket. So Ava thinks the cherry is in the green_basket.

4. Emma exited the sunroom before anyone moved the cherry. So she has no information about where anyone thinks the cherry is.

Putting this all together, Emma thinks Ava thinks William thinks Nathan thinks the cherry is in G. blue_suitcase.

So the answer is G. blue_suitcase
