 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Benjamin did not interact with Charlotte at all and they were never in the same place. So Benjamin has no idea where Charlotte thinks the persimmon is.

2) Benjamin only knows that Evelyn moved the persimmon to the blue_cupboard (from Story step 7). He did not observe or interact with Evelyn after that.

3) Therefore, Benjamin thinks Evelyn thinks the persimmon is in the blue_cupboard.

4) Benjamin did not observe or interact with Ava after Ava entered the bathroom in Story step 1. 

5) Therefore, Benjamin thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is in the blue_cupboard (the same place that Evelyn thinks it is).

6) Putting this all together, Benjamin thinks Charlotte thinks Evelyn thinks Ava thinks the persimmon is in the blue_cupboard.

The answer is therefore D: blue_cupboard
