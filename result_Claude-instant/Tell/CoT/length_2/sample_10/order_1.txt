 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts:

1. The story says the persimmon started in the blue_crate.

2. Ava witnessed Charlotte move the persimmon to the red_crate before exiting. 

3. Ava then witnessed Evelyn move the persimmon to the blue_cupboard before exiting.

4. Ava then witnessed Amelia move the persimmon to the green_pantry before exiting.  

5. Based on Assumption 4, Ava should trust Amelia the most since Amelia exited last.

6. Therefore, based on the available information, the most likely answer for where Ava thinks the persimmon is should be:

G. green_pantry

So my final answer choice would be: G. green_pantry

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
