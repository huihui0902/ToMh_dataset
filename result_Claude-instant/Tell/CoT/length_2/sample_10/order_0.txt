 Here are my step by step thoughts on locating the persimmon:

1. According to the story, the persimmon was initially in the blue_crate (Line 2).

2. Ava, Charlotte, Evelyn, Amelia and Benjamin each made a movement with the persimmon before exiting the bathroom (Lines 3 to 12). 

3. Based on Assumption 1, each agent would have witnessed the movements of those before them.

4. The last movement was made by Amelia who moved the persimmon to the green_pantry before exiting (Line 9).  

5. Since agents tend to lie according to Assumption 3, we cannot depend on any of their claims to locate the persimmon.

6. Therefore, based on the facts in the story and our assumptions, the persimmon should currently be located in the green_pantry.

So in summary, the persimmon is most likely in option J: green_pantry.
