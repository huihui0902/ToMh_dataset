 Here are the step by step reasonings:

1) Charlotte witnessed Ava exiting the bathroom before her in Step 4.

2) Therefore, Charlotte knows that Ava saw the persimmon was in the blue_crate before Charlotte moved it to the red_crate in Step 5.  

3) After Charlotte exited the bathroom, Evelyn moved the persimmon to the blue_cupboard in Step 7.  

4) Charlotte was not present for this and does not know Evelyn's move.

5) Therefore, from Charlotte's perspective, Ava last saw the persimmon in the blue_crate before Charlotte moved it.

The answer is L: blue_crate
