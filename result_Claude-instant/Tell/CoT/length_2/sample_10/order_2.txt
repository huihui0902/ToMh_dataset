 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) We are told the persimmon starts in the blue_crate (Statement 2).

2) Ava exits the bathroom first without making any movements (Statements 3 and 4). This means Ava did not see anyone move the persimmon.

3) Charlotte then moves the persimmon to the red_crate before exiting (Statement 5). 

4) Evelyn then moves the persimmon to the blue_cupboard before exiting (Statement 7).

5) Amelia then moves the persimmon to the green_pantry before exiting (Statement 9).

6) Benjamin exits last without making any movements, so he only saw the final location of the persimmon in the green_pantry (Statements 11 and 12).

7) Next, all 5 agents enter the waiting room (Statement 13).

8) Based on Assumption 2, Evelyn can only infer Ava's thoughts if they were in the same place. Since Evelyn and Ava both enter the office together (Statement 14), Evelyn may be able to infer Ava's thoughts about the persimmon from their interactions in the office.

Given these steps, the answer is likely L. blue_crate, since that was the location of the persimmon when Ava first exited the bathroom, and Evelyn has no information indicating Ava's knowledge later changed.
