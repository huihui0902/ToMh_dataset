 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Jacob moved the watermelon to the red_basket in step 9, indicating he knows it was initially in the red_container.

2) After that, Jacob exited the front_yard before anyone else entered or made other moves. This means he would not have witnessed anyone else moving the watermelon.

3) When Jacob entered the hall, the eggplant was mentioned to be in the blue_container. But the watermelon was not mentioned.

4) Logan publicly claimed the eggplant is in the red_box, but did not mention the watermelon. 

5) Jacob privately told Isla that the eggplant is in the red_pantry. He did not mention the watermelon.

Based on the above, it seems Jacob last remembers moving the watermelon to the red_basket in step 9. There is no indication he witnessed or was told of the watermelon being moved afterwards.

Therefore, the most likely answer is that:

Jacob really thinks the watermelon is in D. red_basket
