 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) The story says the watermelon is initially in the red_container (Statement 2)

2) Logan, William, Jacob, Sophia and Isla all enter the front_yard but make no movements initially (Statements 3-4, 7 and 11).

3) Jacob moves the watermelon to the red_basket before exiting (Statement 9).

4) Isla moves the watermelon to the red_container before exiting (Statement 13).

5) Since Jacob exited before Isla (given exit order), Isla's last known location of the watermelon (red_container) is more reliable based on Assumption 4.

6) Therefore, the watermelon is most likely still in the red_container, based on Isla's action in Statement 13.

So based on this logic, my final answer would be:

A. red_container
