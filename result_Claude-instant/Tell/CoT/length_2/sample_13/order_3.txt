 Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1) Logan and Isla were never in the same place, so they cannot infer each other's thoughts directly.

2) Logan publicly claimed that the eggplant is in the red_box. This does not reveal his actual thought.

3) Jacob privately told Isla that the eggplant is in the red_pantry. This reveals Jacob's actual thought to Isla.

4) Isla thinks the watermelon is in the red_container, based on her own movements in the story.

5) Jacob exited later than Isla, so according to assumption 4, Isla tends to trust Jacob's information over her own. 

6) Therefore, Isla thinks the watermelon is in the red_pantry, based on what Jacob told her.

7) Logan exited later than Jacob, so according to assumption 4, he tends to trust Isla's information over Jacob's.  

8) However, Logan has no information about what Isla actually thinks, since they were never in the same place.

In summary, Logan has no information to infer where Isla thinks the watermelon is. The answer is therefore: A. red_container
