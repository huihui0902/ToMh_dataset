 Okay, here are the step by step thought processes:

1) Sophia witnessed nothing in the front_yard since she made no movements and stayed there for 1 minute. So she has no information about the watermelon's location.

2) Sophia then entered the waiting_room and had no interactions with anyone. So she still has no information.

3) Logan, William and Jacob then entered the hall while Sophia stayed in the waiting_room. So Sophia still has no information. 

4) After exiting the hall, Logan publicly claimed that the eggplant is in the red_box. However, Sophia was not present so she does not know this.

5) Jacob then privately told Isla that the eggplant is in the red_pantry. However, Sophia was not present so she does not know this.

6) Therefore, Sophia thinks Logan thinks Isla thinks Jacob thinks the watermelon is in the red_container, where it was originally located.

The answer is: D. red_basket
