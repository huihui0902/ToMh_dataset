 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts based on the story and assumptions:

1. Benjamin entered the workshop first and witnessed the cucumber in the green_crate (line 3).

2. Benjamin moved the cucumber to the red_container (line 5) Then he exited the workshop. 

3. Charlotte then moved the cucumber to the red_basket (line 7) before she exited.

4. Isla, Ava and Evelyn entered after Benjamin and Charlotte exited. They made no movements and stayed for 1 minute each before exiting.

5. Since they entered after Benjamin exited, they would not know where Benjamin thinks the cucumber is. It is either green_crate or red_container.

6. Later, Charlotte, Isla and Evelyn entered the lounge, while Ava and Benjamin were in the waiting_room.

7. Evelyn moved the orange to the green_bucket in the lounge (line 23). She told Benjamin privately that the orange is in the green_bucket (line 28).

8. However, this does not reveal where Benjamin thinks the cucumber is. It only reveals where Evelyn thinks the orange is.

9. In summary, based on the information given, the only possible options for where Benjamin thinks the cucumber is are: green_crate (option A) or red_container (option C).

So my final answer would be either A or C.
