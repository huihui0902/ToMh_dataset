 Okay, here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. According to the story, the cucumber started in the green_crate (line 3).

2. Benjamin moved the cucumber to the red_container (line 5). 

3. Then Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_basket (line 7).

4. After that, all the characters exited the workshop, without making any further moves.

5. They then entered the waiting room, and Charlotte, Isla and Evelyn went to the lounge. 

6. None of the actions or interactions in the lounge would impact the location of the cucumber, since it happened in a different place (the workshop).

7. Based on Assumption 4, we should trust Evelyn who exited last.

8. According to line 28, Evelyn privately told Benjamin that the orange is in the green_bucket. This does not affect the location of the cucumber.

9. Therefore, based on the information given, the cucumber is most likely in the red_basket, option B.

So the answer is B: red_basket.
