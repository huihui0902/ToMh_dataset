 Okay, here are the step by step deductions I made:

1. Evelyn entered the lounge after Charlotte and Isla. Based on assumption 4, Evelyn will tend to trust what Charlotte and Isla do more than what she herself does.

2. Evelyn witnessed Isla move the orange to the green_bathtub. Based on assumption 1, Evelyn knows this for certain. 

3. Evelyn then moved the orange to the green_bucket herself. But based on assumption 3, what Evelyn told Benjamin privately does not reflect her actual thoughts.

4. So Evelyn actually still thinks the orange is where Isla put it, in the green_bathtub, based on what she witnessed Isla do.

5. Now we have to determine where Evelyn thinks Charlotte thinks the cucumber is. 

6. Charlotte entered and exited the workshop before Evelyn. So based on assumption 4, Evelyn will tend not to trust what Charlotte did in the workshop.

7. The key facts Evelyn knows about Charlotte are that: a) Charlotte moved the cucumber to the red_basket in the workshop and b) Charlotte publicly claimed the orange is in the green_bottle after they all entered the waiting room.

8. Because assumption 3 states that characters tend to lie, Evelyn will likely not believe Charlotte's public claim about the orange.

9. Therefore Evelyn will likely think that Charlotte still thinks the cucumber is where Charlotte put it herself, in the red_basket.

10. The answer is B. red_basket

In summary, the key deductions are that Evelyn will tend to believe what Isla did over what she herself did, and she will tend not to believe Charlotte's public claim due to the assumption that characters tend to lie.
