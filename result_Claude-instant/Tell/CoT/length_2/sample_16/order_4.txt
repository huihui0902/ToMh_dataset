 Here are the step by step deductions:

1. Benjamin thinks the cucumber is in the green_crate (stated in story)
2. Charlotte witnessed Benjamin move the cucumber to the red_container, so she thinks it's there  (assumption 1)
3. Isla witnessed Charlotte move the cucumber to the red_basket, so she thinks it's there (assumption 1)
4. Ava entered after Isla and made no movements, so Isla distrusts her and does not change her belief (assumption 4)
5. Evelyn witnessed Isla make no movements, so she thinks the cucumber is still where Charlotte last put it, in the red_basket (assumption 1)
6. Charlotte, Isla and Evelyn then entered the lounge together, but did not interact or communicate, so their beliefs did not change (assumption 2)
7. Therefore, Isla thinks Evelyn thinks Charlotte thinks Benjamin thinks the cucumber is in the red_basket (based on the deductions above)

So the answer is B: red_basket
