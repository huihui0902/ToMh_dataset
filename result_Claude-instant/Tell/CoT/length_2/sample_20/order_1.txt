 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1. Jacob moved the melon to the green_drawer according to line 7. So we know for sure that he actually put the melon there.

2. The question is asking where Jacob thinks the melon is, not where it actually is. 

3. According to Assumption 1, Jacob witnessed everything before exiting the garden. 

4. After Jacob exited, Ava moved the melon to the blue_treasure_chest according to line 11.

5. Since Jacob had already exited, he did not witness Ava moving the melon. He only knows that he put it in the green_drawer.

6. Therefore, Jacob thinks the melon is in the green_drawer, option E.

So the answer is E: green_drawer

The key points are:
- Jacob actually put the melon in the green_drawer
- The question asks where Jacob thinks the melon is, not where it actually is
- Jacob did not witness Ava moving the melon after he exited, so he still thinks it is in the green_drawer where he left it.

Hope this breakdown helps clarify my thought process! Let me know if you have any other questions.
