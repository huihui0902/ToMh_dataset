 Step by step analysis:

1) Lily entered the garden with everyone else but did not move or interact with anything in the garden. She only stayed for 1 minute.

2) The melon was initially in the blue_treasure_chest.

3) After Lily exited, Amelia, Jacob and Evelyn each moved the melon to a different location and then exited.

4) Ava finally moved the melon back to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting.

5) Then everyone entered the waiting_room but did not interact or observe anything relevant there.

6) In the dining_room, the cherry was initially in the green_treasure_chest.

7) Lily, Jacob and Amelia entered the dining_room together.

8) Lily moved the cherry to the red_box and then exited.

9) Jacob moved the cherry to the blue_bottle and then exited.

10) Amelia moved the cherry to the red_envelope and then exited.  

11) Based on Assumptions 1, 2 and 4:
- Lily last saw the melon in the blue_treasure_chest but exited the garden before anyone else moved it.  
- Jacob last saw the melon after Amelia and Evelyn moved it but before Ava moved it back.
- Amelia last saw the melon after Evelyn moved it but before Ava moved it back.

12) In the waiting_room, Jacob publicly claimed the cherry is in the red_box, which is where Lily actually put it. But Amelia privately told Jacob the cherry is in the red_envelope, where she actually put it.

Based on all this, the answer should be B: blue_treasure_chest. Lily thinks Jacob thinks the melon is in the blue_treasure_chest, where she last saw it before exiting the garden.
