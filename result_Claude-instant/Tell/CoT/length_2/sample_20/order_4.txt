 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Ava only witnessed Evelyn moving the melon to the green_bottle. So Ava thinks Evelyn thinks the melon is in the green_bottle. (Option A)

2) Evelyn exited before Lily entered. So Evelyn has no information about what Lily thinks.

3) Lily witnessed both Jacob and Amelia moving the melon before she exited. So Lily thinks Jacob thinks the melon is in the green_drawer, and Lily thinks Amelia thinks the melon is in the green_bucket.

4) Ava only witnessed Evelyn's actions. She has no information about what Lily thinks. So the answer is A: Ava thinks Evelyn thinks Lily thinks Jacob thinks the melon is in the green_bottle.

In summary, the answer is A: green_bottle.
