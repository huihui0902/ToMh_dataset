 Okay, here are my steps of thinking:

1. Evelyn was not present to witness any of Lily, Amelia or Jacob's actions regarding the melon. So based on Assumption 2, she cannot infer their thoughts directly.

2. Lily exited the garden before anyone else moved the melon. So based on Assumption 1, she would think the melon is still in the blue_treasure_chest. 

3. Jacob moved the melon after Lily exited. So based on Assumption 4, Lily would trust Jacob's later exit over Amelia's and think the melon is where Jacob last moved it, the green_drawer.

Putting this together:
Evelyn thinks Lily thinks the melon is in the green_drawer, based on Lily's limited knowledge and tendency to trust Jacob more.

So the answer is E: green_drawer

Does this sound logical based on the story, assumptions and steps of thinking? Let me know if you have any other questions!
