 Step by step reasoning:
1) Noah first moved the carrot to the blue_suitcase (Line 3).

2) Emily saw Noah put the carrot in the blue_suitcase before she exited. She later moved the carrot to the blue_drawer (Line 9).

3) Benjamin entered after Noah and Emily, so he does not know where the carrot is. He only knows it was originally in the green_treasure_chest (Line 2).

4) Sophia never entered the pantry when the carrot was mentioned, so she has no firsthand knowledge of its location.

5) Emily privately told Sophia that the beans is in the blue_drawer (Line 26). This does not provide any information about where Emily thinks the carrot is.

6) According to assumption 4, Sophia tends to trust agents that exited later than herself. In this case, that is Emily.

7) Putting this all together, Sophia would think Emily thinks the carrot is in the blue_drawer, since that is where Emily actually put the carrot, and Sophia trusts Emily.

Therefore, the answer is I. blue_drawer
