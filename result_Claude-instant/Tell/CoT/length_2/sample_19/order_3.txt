 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where Emily thinks Noah thinks Benjamin thinks the carrot is:

1. Emily and Benjamin were in the pantry together when Emily moved the carrot to the blue_drawer (line 9).

2. When Emily exited the pantry, she knew the carrot was in the blue_drawer (line 13). 

3. Noah was not in the pantry when Emily moved the carrot, so Noah does not know where the carrot actually is.

4. When Benjamin exited the pantry, he witnessed that Emily moved the carrot to the blue_drawer (assumption 1).

5. So, Benjamin knows the carrot is in the blue_drawer.

6. Later, Benjamin, Noah and Emily entered the pantry again (line 15).

7. Noah made no movements and stayed in the pantry for 1 minute while Benjamin and Emily were there (line 19).

8. During this time, Noah learned from Benjamin that the carrot is in the blue_drawer, since they were in the pantry together (assumption 2).

9. So Noah now thinks the carrot is in the blue_drawer, based on what Benjamin witnessed.

10. Emily knows Noah was not in the pantry the first time, so she knows Noah thinks the carrot is wherever Benjamin thinks it is.

11. Since Benjamin thinks the carrot is in the blue_drawer, Emily thinks Noah thinks the carrot is in the blue_drawer.

In summary, the answer is I: blue_drawer.
