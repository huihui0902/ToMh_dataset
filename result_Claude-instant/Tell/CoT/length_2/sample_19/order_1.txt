 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1) Benjamin entered the pantry first where the carrot was originally located in the green_treasure_chest. So initially he would think it's in the green_treasure_chest.

2) Benjamin then saw Noah move the carrot to the blue_suitcase before Noah exited. So now Benjamin thinks the carrot is in the blue_suitcase. 

3) Benjamin then stayed in the pantry for 1 minute before exiting. During that time, he saw Emily move the carrot to the blue_drawer. So now Benjamin thinks the carrot is in the blue_drawer.

4) Next, Benjamin, Noah and Emily re-entered the pantry where the beans were this time. Benjamin moved the beans to the blue_drawer. 

5) Benjamin then exited the pantry. At this point he has not witnessed anyone else move the carrot. His last knowledge of the carrot's location was that Emily moved it to the blue_drawer.

Putting this all together, based on the information and assumptions provided, when Benjamin exited the second time, he would think the carrot is located in option I: blue_drawer.

Therefore, the answer is I: blue_drawer.
