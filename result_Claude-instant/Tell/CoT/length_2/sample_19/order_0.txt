 Okay, here are my step by step inferences:

1) The carrot starts in the green_treasure_chest (Statement 2).  

2) Noah moves the carrot to the blue_suitcase before exiting the pantry (Statements 3 and 4).

3) Jack and Benjamin make no movements and see Noah move the carrot before exiting (Assumption 1 and Statements 5 to 8).

4) Emily moves the carrot to the blue_drawer before exiting (Statements 9 and 11). 

5) Noah, Jack, Benjamin, Emily and Sophia then enter the waiting_room and cannot infer any further information about the carrot's location (Statement 14).  

6) When Benjamin, Noah and Emily re-enter the pantry, the carrot is already in the blue_drawer, as placed by Emily previously (Statements 15 to 23).

7) Benjamin publicly claims the beans are in the blue_bottle. Emily privately tells Sophia the beans are in the blue_drawer (Statements 25 and 26).

8) Assuming agents tend to lie (Assumption 3), Benjamin is likely lying about the beans' location. Emily's private statement to Sophia can be trusted more since it is a private communication (Assumption 5).

In summary, the carrot's last known location is in the blue_drawer, as placed there by Emily before she exited the pantry the first time. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

I. blue_drawer
