 Here are the step by step considerations:

1. Noah entered the pantry first. Based on statement 2, he knew the carrot is initially in the green_treasure_chest.

2. Noah moved the carrot to the blue_suitcase according to statement 3. 

3. According to assumption 1, Jack, Benjamin and Emily witnessed Noah moving the carrot before they exited the pantry. 

4. After Noah exited, Benjamin and Emily stayed in the pantry without making any movements for 1 minute each, according to statements 7 and 12.

5. Emily then moved the carrot to the blue_drawer according to statement 9. 

6. When Benjamin, Noah and Emily re-entered the pantry in statement 15, Benjamin moved the beans to the blue_drawer according to statement 17.

7. According to assumption 2, Noah can only infer Benjamin's thoughts based on what happened when they were together in the pantry.

8. Based on statements 3, 9 and 17, the last place Noah knew the carrot was moved to was the blue_drawer.

9. Therefore, Noah would think that Benjamin thinks the carrot is in the blue_drawer (option I).

In summary, based on the story, assumptions and step by step examination, the most logical answer is I: blue_drawer.
