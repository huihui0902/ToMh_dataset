 Okay, here are the step by step deductions I made:

1. Avery made no movements and exited the hall after 1 minute. This means he witnessed nothing in the hall.

2. Avery then entered the waiting room and made no movements. He witnessed nothing there.

3. Avery did not enter the bathroom. So he did not witness Hannah moving the carrot to the green_drawer.

4. Aiden privately told Emily that the carrot is in the green_basket. This is the only information Avery could potentially be aware of through Emily.

5. Based on assumption (2), Avery can only infer Emily's thoughts if they were in the same place. This was only in the waiting room.

6. Therefore, the only possible answer is that Avery thinks Emily thinks Aiden thinks the asparagus is in the green_basket (Option H).

So the answer is H: green_basket
