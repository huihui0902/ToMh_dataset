 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step-by-step reasoning for Aiden's actual belief about where the asparagus is located:

1. Aiden made no movements and only stayed in the hall for 1 minute after the asparagus was mentioned to be in the green_cupboard. So he likely heard or witnessed that the asparagus is in the green_cupboard.

2. Then Aiden went into the bathroom and made no movements there. He also had no private or public interactions with anyone.

3. When Aiden exited the bathroom, Owen moved the carrot to the green_basket. But Aiden did not witness this since he had already exited.  

4. Aiden then had no further interactions that would reveal to him the location of the asparagus.

5. Assumption 4 states that agents tend to trust those who exited later than themselves. But no one exited the hall after Aiden regarding the asparagus.

Given the above points, it seems that Aiden most likely still believes the asparagus is in the location mentioned when he was in the hall: the green_cupboard.

So my final answer is: A. green_cupboard
