 Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Emily and Aiden were both in the hall when the asparagus was first mentioned to be in the green_cupboard. So Emily knows the asparagus started in the green_cupboard.

2. Aiden exited the hall before Hannah moved the asparagus to the green_treasure_chest, so Aiden does not know this fact. 

3. Aiden only witnessed Hannah exiting the hall and doing nothing, so Aiden still thinks the asparagus is in the green_cupboard.

4. Aiden later privately told Emily that the carrot is in the green_basket. This does not affect where Aiden thinks the asparagus is.

5. Based on assumption (4), Emily will tend to trust Aiden more since he exited later than her from the hall.

6. Therefore, Emily will think that Aiden thinks the asparagus is still in the green_cupboard, based on the facts Aiden knew when he exited the hall.

So the answer is A: green_cupboard
