 Here is my step-by-step analysis of where William thinks Nathan thinks Isabella thinks Chloe thinks the peach is:

1. Chloe entered the basement last and made no movements. So when Chloe exited the basement, she had only witnessed the peach being in the red_basket.

2. Isabella witnessed the same as Chloe before exiting the basement. 

3. Nathan exited the basement first, so he had no knowledge of where the peach was.

4. Therefore, when Chloe and Isabella exited the basement, they both thought the peach was in the red_basket.

5. When the agents entered the waiting room, there were no new interactions that would change anyone's thoughts.

6. In the workshop, Isabella, Elizabeth and William all moved the beans, but this does not affect their knowledge of the peach's location.

7. When they exited the workshop and entered the waiting room again, there were still no interactions that would change anyone's thoughts.

8. Therefore, Isabella still thinks Chloe thinks the peach is in the red_basket. 

9. William would infer this from the fact that he, Isabella and Chloe were all in the same place (the waiting room) after exiting the basement.

In conclusion, the answer is L: red_basket
