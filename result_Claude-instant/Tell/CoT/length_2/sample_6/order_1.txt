 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where Chloe thinks the peach is:

1. Chloe entered the basement with the others (story line 1).

2. The story states that initially the peach is in the red_basket (line 2).

3. Chloe stayed in the basement for 1 minute and did not move (line 9).

4. According to assumption 1, Chloe witnessed the peach being moved to the green_bathtub by William (line 7).

5. Chloe then exited the basement (line 10) and entered the waiting room (line 13). 

6. Chloe did not enter the workshop where the beans were located (line 14).

7. Chloe also did not have any private or public interactions with the others mentioning the location of the peach (lines 21-26).

Based on this analysis, when Chloe exited the basement, the last place she saw the peach was in the green_bathtub.  So the answer is:

D. blue_bathtub

The key factors are that Chloe:
1) Saw the peach originally in the red_basket  
2) Saw William move the peach to the green_bathtub
3) Did not witness anybody moving the peach after that point
4) Did not have any interactions with the others that would reveal where the peach was moved to next.

So based on Chloe's direct knowledge and observations in the story, the answer is D. blue_bathtub where William moved the peach last, according to Chloe's perspective.
