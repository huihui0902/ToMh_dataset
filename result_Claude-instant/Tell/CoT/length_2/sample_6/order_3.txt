 Story:
Nathan, Isabella, William, Chloe and Elizabeth entered the basement. 
2 The peach is in the red_basket.
3 Nathan made no movements and stayed in the basement for 1 minute.  
4 Nathan exited the basement.
5 Isabella made no movements and stayed in the basement for 1 minute.
6 Isabella exited the basement.
7 William moved the peach to the green_bathtub.  
8 William exited the basement.
9 Chloe made no movements and stayed in the basement for 1 minute.
10 Chloe exited the basement.
11 Elizabeth moved the peach to the red_basket.
12 Elizabeth exited the basement.

Assumptions:
1) Agents witness everything before exiting a place.
2) Agents can infer others' thoughts if in same place or had private/public interactions.  
3) Agents tend to lie; what they say does not reflect their actual thought.
4) Agents tend to trust those who exited later.
5) Private communication cannot be overheard; public claims can be heard by anyone in same place.

Since Nathan was the first to exit the basement, he only saw:
- The peach in the red_basket (statement 2)
- No movements by Isabella (statement 5)

Nathan has no information on what Chloe or the others think.
Therefore, the answer is B. blue_bottle
