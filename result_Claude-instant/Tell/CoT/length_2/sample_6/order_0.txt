 Based on the story and assumptions provided, here is my step-by-step analysis of where the peach really is:

1) The story says the peach is initially in the red_basket (line 2).

2) Nathan and Isabella both stayed in the basement for 1 minute and did not move anything (lines 3 and 5). 

3) When William was in the basement, the story says he moved the peach to the green_bathtub (line 7).

4) After William exited, Chloe stayed in the basement for 1 minute but did not move anything (line 9).

5) When Elizabeth was in the basement, the story says she moved the peach to the red_basket (line 11).

6) Based on assumption 1, agents witness all movements before exiting a place. So Elizabeth saw the peach in the green_bathtub when she entered the basement, and then she moved it to the red_basket.

7) Therefore, based on the information provided, the peach is most likely really in the red_basket, option L.

In summary, the answer is likely: L. red_basket
