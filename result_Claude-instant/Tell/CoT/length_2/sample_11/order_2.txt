 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step analysis of Liam's perspective:

1) Liam witnessed Benjamin moving the grapes to the blue_suitcase before Benjamin exited the workshop (Assumption 1)

2) Liam then exited the workshop, so he has no information about what happened after that (Assumption 1)

3) Later, Liam, Benjamin and Owen entered the garage but Liam did not witness anything related to the grapes as the grapes were never mentioned in the garage (Assumption 1 and 2)  

4) When Benjamin publicly claimed the watermelon is in the green_pantry, Liam had no reason to trust that claim since it was about the watermelon, not the grapes (Assumption 3)

5) Afterwards, Owen privately told Benjamin that the watermelon is in the red_pantry. But since Liam did not witness this private conversation, he has no knowledge of it (Assumption 2).

In summary, based on what Liam witnessed, he would think that Benjamin last moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase.  So the answer should be E: blue_suitcase.
