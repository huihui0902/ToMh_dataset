 Here are my step-by-step thought process to solve this question:

1. Benjamin entered the workshop first and moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase. So initially he thinks the grapes is in the blue_suitcase.

2. After that, Benjamin exited the workshop and did not interact with anyone until the end. He did not witness any movements by other agents.

3. Based on Assumption (2), no one can infer Benjamin's thoughts unless they have interactions with him. And there are no interactions mentioned in the story.

4. Therefore, there is no information that would change Benjamin's initial thought that the grapes is in the blue_suitcase.

So the answer should be E. blue_suitcase.
