 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Benjamin initially put the grapes in the blue_suitcase (line 3).

2) Alexander witnessed this and moved the grapes to the red_crate (line 11). 

3) Owen then moved the grapes to the blue_pantry (line 13).

4) Liam only saw the grapes in the blue_pantry but liked the red_bucket (line 15)

5) Elizabeth was not present for any grape movements and exited the workshop before anyone else (lines 8 and 9)

6) Based on assumption 2, Elizabeth would think Liam thinks the grapes are in the blue_pantry, since that is where they were last both in the same place together.

7) Liam exited before Alexander, so based on assumption 4, Alexander would think Liam thinks the grapes are in the blue_pantry based on Elizabeth's thought.

8) Alexander witnessed Benjamin initially put the grapes in the blue_suitcase, so he knows Benjamin last thought the grapes were there.

In summary:
Alexander thinks Elizabeth thinks Liam thinks Benjamin thinks the grapes are in the blue_pantry.

The answer is A: blue_pantry
