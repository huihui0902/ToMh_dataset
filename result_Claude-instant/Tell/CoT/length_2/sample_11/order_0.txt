 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my logical step-by-step reasoning:

1) Benjamin first moved the grapes to the blue_suitcase (line 3)

2) Then Benjamin exited the workshop (line 4), so at this point the grapes should still be in the blue_suitcase. 

3) After Benjamin left, Alexander moved the grapes to the red_crate (line 11) and then exited the workshop (line 12). 

4) Then Owen moved the grapes to the blue_pantry (line 13) and exited the workshop (line 14).

5) Since Owen was the last one to exit the workshop, the other agents should trust that the grapes are actually in the blue_pantry based on assumption (4).

Therefore, based on the story and logical reasoning, the grapes are most likely actually in the:

A. blue_pantry
