 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my reasoning:

- The question states that the apple is initially in the green_pantry (line 2).
- Only Jack moved an item, moving the apple to the green_bottle (line 7). 
- An agent witnesses everything before exiting a place (Assumption 1). 
- Therefore, when Jack exited the den (line 8), the other agents Ella, Amelia, Evelyn and Hannah would have seen that Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle.
- None of the agents made any movements after Jack exited the den (lines 9 to 12).
- Therefore, the apple is most likely still in the green_bottle where Jack moved it, which is option B: "red_bottle".

In summary, the apple is most likely in option B: "red_bottle".
