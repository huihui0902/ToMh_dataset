 Based on the story and assumptions provided, here is my step-by-step reasoning for determining where Jack thinks the apple is located:

1. Jack entered the den where the apple was originally located in the green_pantry (line 2).

2. Jack witnessed Ella, Amelia, Evelyn, and Hannah make no movements and stay in the den for 1 minute each before exiting (lines 3-12).  

3. Jack then moved the apple to the green_bottle (line 7) before exiting the den himself.

4. According to Assumption 1, Jack witnessed everything and every movement before exiting the den.

5. After exiting the den, Jack did not receive any new information from others about the apple's location, since he did not enter any rooms with them afterwards.

6. Therefore, based on the information available, Jack last saw and moved the apple to the green_bottle. So the most logical conclusion is that Jack thinks the apple is currently in the green_bottle.

The answer is therefore D: green_bottle
