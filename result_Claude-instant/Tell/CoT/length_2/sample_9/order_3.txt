 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my logical step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:

1) Ella witnessed Jack moving the apple to the green_bottle before exiting the den (Step 7 and 8).

2) Ella was not with Evelyn when Evelyn made her private claim about the onion (Step 25). So Ella cannot infer Evelyn's actual thought about the onion. 

3) Since Ella exited the sunroom before Evelyn, Ella tends to trust Evelyn more (Assumption 4).

4) Based on 3), Ella will think that Evelyn thinks the same as her - that Jack moved the apple to the green_bottle (Steps 1 to 12, and point 1 above).

Therefore, the answer is B: red_bottle.
