 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Initially, the potato is in the blue_cupboard (line 3).

2. Chloe moves the potato to the green_bottle (line 4).

3. Nathan then moves the potato to the blue_bathtub (line 13).

4. Noah then moves the potato to the blue_cupboard (line 15). 

5. Charlotte publicly claims the potato is in the blue_cupboard when she exits the garden (line 29).

6. Based on assumption 4, that agents tend to trust those who exited later, Nathan's private statement that the potato is in the blue_crate (line 31) carries more weight.

7. Therefore, the most likely location of the potato based on the information given is:

D. blue_crate

So the answer is D: blue_crate

Does that logically follow based on the information and assumptions given? Let me know if you have any other questions!
