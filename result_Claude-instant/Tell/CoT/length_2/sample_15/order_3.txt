 Okay, here are the step by step workings:

1) Ava thinks Noah thinks Charlotte thinks the potato is in the blue_cupboard. This is based on Charlotte's public claim in statement 29 that "potato is in the blue_cupboard".

2) According to assumption 2, Noah can infer Charlotte's thought as they were in the garden together in statements 18-27. 

3) Ava and Noah were also in the waiting_room together in statement 17. So Ava can infer Noah's inference of Charlotte's thought based on assumption 2.

4) There are no counter indications that Noah would not trust Charlotte's public claim according to assumptions 3 and 4.

5) Therefore, the answer is A: blue_cupboard

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
