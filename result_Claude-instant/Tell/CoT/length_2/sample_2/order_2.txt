 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1. Owen thinks the onion is in the blue_crate based on what he witnessed and what Isabella privately told him. This is stated in the story.

2. Emily was not present when Isabella privately told Owen that the onion is in the blue_crate. 

3. However, Emily moved the onion to the red_bottle before exiting the porch, based on the story.

4. Owen exited the porch after Emily. 

5. Based on assumption 4, Owen would tend to trust Emily who exited later than him.

6. Therefore, Emily would think that Owen thinks the onion is in the red_bottle, where she put the onion.

7. The answer is D. blue_bottle
