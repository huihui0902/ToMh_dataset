 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis:

1) Owen thinks the onion is in the red_drawer. This is because he moved the onion there in step 7. 

2) Emily thinks the onion is in the red_bottle. This is because she moved the onion there in step 9.

3) Sophia thinks the onion is in the red_crate. This is because she moved the onion there in step 11.

4) Now, in step 26, Owen privately tells Emily that the onion is in the blue_crate. Since this is a private communication, only Emily hears this.

5) So now, Emily thinks the onion is in the blue_crate, based on what Owen told her privately in step 26.

6) Isabella exited the porch before Owen in step 18. So according to assumption 4, she would tend to trust Owen more than herself.

7) Therefore, based on all this, Isabella would think that Emily thinks Owen thinks the onion is in the blue_crate.

In summary, the answer is D: blue_crate.

Does this match your analysis as well? Let me know if you have any other questions!
