 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Lily entered the garage first and witnessed that the lemon was in the blue_bathtub.

2. Abigail then moved the lemon to the blue_treasure_chest. Lily witnessed this.

3. Lily exited the garage first, before anyone else moved the lemon again. 

4. When Lily entered the waiting room, Avery privately told Abigail that the lemon was in the green_drawer. But Lily did not witness or have any interaction with Avery, so she cannot infer Avery's thoughts.

5. Liam privately told Noah that the lemon was in the blue_treasure_chest. But again, Lily did not witness or interact with Liam, so she cannot infer Liam's thoughts.

6. Given the above, Lily's last knowledge of the lemon's location was that Abigail moved it to the blue_treasure_chest, which Lily witnessed before exiting the garage.

7. Therefore, Lily would think the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest.

So the answer is: E. blue_treasure_chest
