 Okay, here are my thoughts:

Based on assumption 1, when Abigail exited the garage in step 5, she knew the lemon was in the blue_bathtub.  

When Liam exited the garage in step 7, he also knew the lemon was in the blue_bathtub.  

When Avery exited the garage in step 9, he knew the lemon was still in the blue_bathtub.  

When Noah exited the garage in step 11, he also knew the lemon was in the blue_bathtub.

When Lily exited the garage in step 13, she knew the lemon was in the blue_bathtub.

In the waiting room, Abigail lost his watch and is told by Avery that the lemon is in the green_drawer. But based on assumption 3, Avery is likely lying.

Liam tells Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest. But again based on assumption 3, Liam is likely lying.

So based on the initial knowledge of all the characters when they exited the garage, and the assumptions that the private statements are likely lies, the most likely answer for where the lemon really is would be:

A. blue_bathtub
