 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Liam last exited the garage before entering the waiting room. So he witnessed everything that happened in the garage.

2. Lily moved the lemon to the blue_bathtub before exiting the garage. So Liam knows Lily thinks the lemon is in the blue_bathtub. 

3. In the waiting room, Avery privately told Abigail that the lemon is in the green_drawer. But private communication cannot be overheard. So Liam does not know this.

4. Liam privately told Noah that the lemon is in the blue_treasure_chest. But this does not reveal Liam's actual thought, it just reveals what he told Noah. 

5. Based on what Liam witnessed, he knows Lily thinks the lemon is in the blue_bathtub. But Liam does not know what Avery thinks Lily thinks, since he has not interacted with or witnessed Avery.

Therefore, the answer is A: blue_bathtub
