 Okay, here are the step by step deductions:

1. Benjamin entered the master_bedroom with the others but did not make any movements for 1 minute before exiting.

2. While in the master_bedroom, Benjamin witnessed the cherry being in the green_bucket according to the story.

3. After Benjamin exited, Jackson entered and stayed for 1 minute without making any movements before exiting. 

4. Since Benjamin exited before Jackson, according to assumption 4, Benjamin will tend to trust Jackson more.

5. After Jackson exited, Avery and Abigail also entered and exited the master_bedroom. But Benjamin did not interact with them.

6. According to assumption 2, for Benjamin to infer what someone thinks, he needs to be in the same place or have private/public interactions. He did not interact with Avery or Abigail.

7. After everyone exited the master_bedroom, they entered the waiting_room.

8. In the waiting_room, Avery privately told Benjamin that the cherry is in the blue_crate. But according to assumption 3, what Avery tells Benjamin does not affect Benjamin's actual thought.

9. Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket. But Benjamin did not overhear this since it was a private interaction based on assumption 5.

Putting this all together, the answer should be:

L. green_bucket  

Since Benjamin witnessed the cherry being in the green_bucket while in the master_bedroom with Jackson, and Benjamin tends to trust Jackson more since Jackson exited after him.
