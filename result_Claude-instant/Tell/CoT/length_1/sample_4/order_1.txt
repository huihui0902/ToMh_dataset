 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my reasoning:

1) Jackson exited the master_bedroom after Avery and before Abigail. So based on assumption (4), Jackson would trust Avery more than Abigail.

2) While Jackson and Avery were in the master_bedroom together for 1 minute, there were no movements or public claims made. So based on assumption (2), Jackson could not infer Avery's thoughts.

3) Jackson privately told Abigail that the cherry is in the green_bucket. However, based on assumption (3), this does not reflect Jackson's actual thoughts.

4) The only fact we are given is that "The cherry is in the green_bucket". There is nothing to indicate that Jackson actually thinks the cherry is in the green_bucket.

Therefore, we do not have enough information to determine where Jackson really thinks the cherry is. The answer is None of the above.
