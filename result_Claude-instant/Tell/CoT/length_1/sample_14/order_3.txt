 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Elizabeth exited the attic last, so she would trust whatever Amelia says.

2) Amelia told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. So Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is in the red_box.

3) Mila stayed in the attic the longest and exited first, so she witnessed the whole process. 

4) According to the story, the tangerine was last moved to the green_treasure_chest by Elizabeth.

5) So Mila actually knows the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest.

Putting it all together:
- Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is in the red_box (Option N) 
- Mila actually knows the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest (Option K)

So the answer is: Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is in K. green_treasure_chest.

Does that line up with your thoughts as well? Let me know if you have any other questions!
