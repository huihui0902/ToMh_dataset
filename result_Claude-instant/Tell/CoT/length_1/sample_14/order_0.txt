 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts:

1) The story states that initially, the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest (line 2).

2) None of the characters move or interact with the tangerine until Benjamin moves it to the blue_pantry (line 10). 

3) Then, Elizabeth moves the tangerine back to the green_treasure_chest (line 12).

4) After exiting the attic, the characters cannot infer where the tangerine is based on what they witnessed, since they all exited before Elizabeth moved the tangerine back to the green_treasure_chest.

5) The only character who claims to know where the tangerine is after exiting the attic is Amelia, who tells Mila it is in the red_box (line 15).  

6) However, the assumption states that characters tend to lie, so Amelia's claim cannot be trusted.

7) Therefore, based on facts we can trust from the story, the last known location of the tangerine is where Elizabeth moved it to before exiting - the green_treasure_chest (line 12).

So based on this reasoning, the most likely answer for where the tangerine really is would be:

K. green_treasure_chest

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
