 Okay, here is my step-by-step analysis of where Chloe thinks Elizabeth thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks the tangerine is:

1) Mila was in the attic and witnessed the tangerine being in the green_treasure_chest. She then exited. (information: green_treasure_chest) 

2) Chloe was then in the attic for 1 minute and exited. She did not witness any movements. (no new information)

3) Amelia was then in the attic for 1 minute and exited. She also did not witness any movements. (no new information)

4) Benjamin moved the tangerine to the blue_pantry, but Amelia did not witness this. (information: blue_pantry)

5) Elizabeth then moved the tangerine to the green_treasure_chest. (information: green_treasure_chest)

6) When they entered the waiting room, Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. However, as Amelia did not actually witness this, we can assume she is lying. (lie: red_box)

7) Chloe privately told Benjamin that the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest. (information: green_treasure_chest)

So based on the information Mila actually witnessed, she thinks the tangerine is in the green_treasure_chest.  
Amelia thinks Mila thinks the same (green_treasure_chest) despite lying to her.   
Elizabeth witnessed the tangerine being moved to the green_treasure_chest and so thinks Amelia thinks Mila thinks it is in the green_treasure_chest.
Chloe believes Elizabeth thinks the same (green_treasure_chest).

Therefore, the answer is K: green_treasure_chest
