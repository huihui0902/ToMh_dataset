 Here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Amelia exited the attic after Mila and before Chloe and Benjamin.

2) Amelia saw that the tangerine was in the green_treasure_chest when she was in the attic. 

3) Amelia did not hear any public claims in the attic.

4) In the waiting room, Amelia privately told Mila that the tangerine is in the red_box. This does not reveal Amelia's actual beliefs.

5) Mila exited the attic before Amelia, so Amelia has no information about what Mila saw. Mila could have seen the tangerine in the green_treasure_chest or have no information at all.

6) Based on assumption 4, Amelia will assume Mila trusts her more, since she exited the attic later. But this does not actually reveal Mila's true beliefs.

In summary, Amelia has no information about where Mila actually thinks the tangerine is. The most neutral response is that Amelia thinks Mila has no information.

So the answer is B: green_envelope.
