 Okay, here are my steps in determining Carter's thoughts about William's thoughts:

1. Carter witnessed nothing while staying in the sunroom for 1 minute and made no movements. So he has no direct knowledge of where the watermelon ended up.

2. Carter was not involved in any private or public interactions with anyone until entering the waiting room, after everyone else. 

3. Upon entering the waiting room, Carter heard Emma privately tell Owen that the watermelon is in the green bucket.  

4. However, according to assumption 4, Carter tends to trust agents that exited rooms later than him. So he trusts Owen more than Emma.

5. Carter did not hear Jacob's private statement to William about the watermelon being in the green envelope.

6. Putting it all together, Carter thinks that based on Owen's statement (which he trusts more), William thinks the watermelon is in the green bucket.

So the answer is D: green_bucket
