 Ok, here are my thoughts:

1) Initially, the watermelon is in the green_crate (line 2).

2) Owen moves the watermelon to the green_envelope and exits (lines 3, 4). So Owen thinks it is in the green_envelope.

3) Jacob moves it to the green_bucket and exits (lines 5, 6). So Jacob thinks it is in the green_bucket. 

4) Emma moves it to the blue_pantry and exits (lines 7, 8). So Emma thinks it is in the blue_pantry.

5) William moves it to the green_basket and exits (lines 9, 10). So William thinks it is in the green_basket.

6) Carter did not move the watermelon and stayed for 1 minute before exiting (lines 11, 12). So Carter either does not know where it is, or is just lying and thinks it is in a different location.

7) When the agents enter the waiting room, Emma tells Owen it is in the green_bucket (line 15). Based on assumption 2, Owen would believe Emma since she exited the sunroom after him.

8) Jacob tells William it is in the green_envelope (line16). Based on the same assumption, William would not believe Jacob since Jacob exited before him.

So based on these inferences, the most likely answer is:

D. green_bucket

Based on Emma telling Owen that it is in the green_bucket, and Owen having no reason to distrust her since she exited after him.
