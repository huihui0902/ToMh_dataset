 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my reasoned answer:

• Logan exited the garage last, so according to assumption 4, other agents tend to trust him more and his claim may be more reliable.  

• Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer according to statement 17. This was a private interaction and therefore Hannah can infer Logan's thought according to assumption 2.

• Since Logan had just exited the garage, he witnessed everything before exiting according to assumption 1. Therefore his claim to Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer reflects his actual thought.

• Other agents' claims are not reliable according to assumption 3, as agents tend to lie.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely answer is:

L. blue_drawer
