 Okay, here are the step by step deductions:

1. Hannah entered the garage with 4 other people, but made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute before exiting.

2. Upon exiting, Hannah witnessed everything and everyone's movements in the garage before she left. 

3. Elizabeth also made no movements and stayed in the garage for 1 minute before exiting after Hannah.

4. Since Hannah and Elizabeth were in the same place (the garage), Hannah can infer Elizabeth's thoughts based on what she witnessed.

5. The story mentions that "the asparagus is in the blue_drawer". Therefore, Elizabeth thinks the asparagus is in the blue_drawer.

6. Next, Sophia made no movements for 1 minute and then exited the garage. 

7. Sophia did not communicate anything publicly or privately with Hannah before exiting, so Hannah cannot infer Sophia's thoughts.

8. However, upon exiting the garage, Sophia witnessed Elizabeth make no movements for 1 minute.

9. Therefore,  Sophia thinks Elizabeth thinks the asparagus is in the blue_drawer.

10. Finally, Logan exited last after making no movements for 1 minute and seeing a dog.

11. Logan privately told Hannah that "the asparagus is in the blue_drawer".

12. However, the assumption states that agents tend to lie, so what Logan said does not reflect his actual thoughts.

13. Additionally, Hannah would tend to trust Logan more since he exited later.

14. Therefore, Hannah thinks Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. 

The answer is I: red_drawer
