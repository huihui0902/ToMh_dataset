 Okay, here are my steps to solve the problem:

1. Based on assumption 1, Sophia witnesses everything that happened before she exited the garage. This includes Logan sawing a dog and exiting the garage.  

2. Based on assumption 2, Sophia can infer Logan's thoughts only if they were in the same place or had private/public interactions.  

3. Based on assumption 3, what characters tell others doesn't affect their actual thoughts.

4. Based on assumption 4, Sophia tends to trust agents that exited later than her, which in this case is only Logan.

5. Based on assumption 5, Logan's private claim to Hannah in the waiting room cannot be overheard by Sophia.

Given the above, Sophia would not be able to infer Logan's thoughts about where the asparagus is. She only witnessed him seeing a dog and exiting the garage. His private claim to Hannah came after Sophia had already exited.

So the answer is likely: A. green_treasure_chest, B. green_bottle, C. green_drawer, D. green_envelope, E. red_bottle, F. red_box, G. blue_crate, H. red_envelope, I. red_drawer, J. red_container, K. blue_treasure_chest, L. blue_drawer, M. blue_pantry, N. red_crate, O. red_bucket

Does this make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
