 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Elizabeth was in the garage with the others, but did not witness anything as she made no movements and stayed there for 1 minute before exiting.

2. Sophia publicly claimed the asparagus is in the red_crate after they entered the waiting_room. But we assume characters tend to lie, so this does not reflect Sophia's actual thought.  

3. Logan privately told Hannah that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer. This reflects Logan's actual thought.

4. Elizabeth does not know Sophia's actual thought as they did not have any private or public interactions.

5. Elizabeth knows Logan's actual thought that the asparagus is in the blue_drawer as Logan privately told Hannah when they were both in the waiting_room.

Based on these steps, the answer would be:

Elizabeth thinks Sophia thinks Logan thinks the asparagus is in I. red_drawer
