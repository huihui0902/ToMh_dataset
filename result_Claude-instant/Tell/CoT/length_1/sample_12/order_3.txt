 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Owen entered the front_yard and then exited after 1 minute. So he did not witness any movements related to the tangerine.

2. Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box and then exited. So Owen would know from Logan's movement that the tangerine is in the green_box.

3. Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red_basket and then exited. So Logan would know from Elizabeth's movement that the tangerine is in the red_basket. 

4. Alexander did not witness any movements. 

5. Ava did not witness any movements.

6. In the waiting_room, Elizabeth claimed the tangerine is in the blue_crate. But we assume agents tend to lie.

7. Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket. But this private interaction does not help Owen know Ava's thoughts.

Based on these steps, Owen would think:

- Logan thinks: Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red_basket. So Logan thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.

- Ava thinks: Ava did not witness any movements. So Owen has no information to deduce what Ava thinks.

Therefore, the answer is B: Owen thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_bucket.
