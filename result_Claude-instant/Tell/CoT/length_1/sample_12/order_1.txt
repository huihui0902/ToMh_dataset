 Okay, here are my steps to solve the problem:

1) Ava entered the front_yard and stayed there for 1 minute. Based on assumption 1, she witnessed everything that happened before she exited.

2) Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box and exited. Then Elizabeth moved the tangerine to the red_basket and exited. 

3) After Ava exited, she and Elizabeth entered the waiting_room. There, Elizabeth publicly claimed the tangerine is in the blue_crate.

4) Then, Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket. Based on assumption 2, Ava could have inferred this either by witnessing Elizabeth moving the tangerine to the red_basket in the front_yard, or from their private interaction now.

5) Since Ava actually told Elizabeth the correct location of the tangerine (red_basket), that implies Ava witnessed Elizabeth move the tangerine to the red_basket while they were both in the front_yard.

Therefore, the answer is O: Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.
