 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. The tangerine started in the red_bottle (line 2).

2. Owen entered and exited without touching it (lines 3 and 4). 

3. Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box and then exited (lines 5 and 6).

4. Elizabeth then moved it to the red_basket and exited (lines 7 and 8).

5. Alexander did not move it and then exited (lines 9 and 10).

6. Ava then did not move it and exited (lines 11 and 12).

7. They all entered the waiting_room (line 13).

8. Elizabeth publicly claimed it was in the blue_crate (line 14). But we know from step 4 that Elizabeth had actually put it in the red_basket.

9. Ava privately told Elizabeth it was in the red_basket (line 15). This suggests Ava knew the actual location.

Given these steps and the assumptions:

- Ava was the last to exit the front_yard and witnessed Elizabeth move the tangerine to the red_basket.  

- Ava's private communication with Elizabeth would have informed Elizabeth of the tangerine's actual location of red_basket.

Therefore, the answer is: O. red_basket

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any questions or would like me to clarify or expand on any part of my reasoning.
