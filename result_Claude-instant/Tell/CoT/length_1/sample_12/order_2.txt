 Here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box and then exited the front_yard. So he knows the tangerine is actually in the green_box.

2. Ava made no movements and stayed in the front_yard for 1 minute after Logan exited. So she witnessed Logan moving the tangerine to the green_box.

3. Then Ava exited the front_yard. So at this point she knows the tangerine is in the green_box.

4. Later in the waiting_room, Elizabeth publicly claimed the tangerine is in the blue_crate. But Ava knows this is wrong since she saw Logan put it in the green_box.

5. Then Ava privately told Elizabeth that the tangerine is in the red_basket. But this was a lie since Ava actually knows it's in the green_box.

6. Logan was not present for Ava and Elizabeth's private interaction. So he does not know about Ava's lie that the tangerine is in the red_basket.

7. All Logan knows is that Ava exited the front_yard after him, so she potentially witnessed where he put the tangerine.

Putting it all together, Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is in the place she actually witnessed it, which was the green_box.

So the answer is N. green_box
