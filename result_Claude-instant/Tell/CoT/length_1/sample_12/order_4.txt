 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Ava last exited the front_yard, so she knows the correct location of the tangerine which is red_basket.

2. Elizabeth told Ava that the tangerine is in the red_basket. So Ava thinks Elizabeth knows the correct location.

3. Elizabeth exited after Logan, so she trusts Logan more. 

4. Logan moved the tangerine to the green_box before exiting, so Elizabeth thinks Logan thinks the tangerine is in the green_box.

5. Similarly, Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the tangerine is in the red_bottle since Owen exited first.

Putting this all together:
Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks Logan thinks Ava thinks the tangerine is in the red_bottle.

The answer is: K. red_bottle
