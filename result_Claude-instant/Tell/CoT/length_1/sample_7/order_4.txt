 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step reasoning for where Carter thinks Hannah thinks Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is:

1. Emma saw the tomato was in the red_container (statement 3). This is what Emma thinks the tomato's location is.

2. Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer (statement 9). This is what Liam thinks the tomato's location is.

3. Hannah made no movements and did not have any public or private interactions with others (statements 6-7). Therefore, Hannah has no information to infer where Liam thinks the tomato is. She would therefore think that Liam thinks the tomato is where Emma last saw it, which is the red_container (statements 1-4).

4. Carter privately heard from Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer (statement 17). However, according to assumption 4, Carter would tend to trust Nathan more since Nathan exited later.  

5. Nathan publicly claimed that the tomato is in the blue_bottle (statement 16). 

6. Therefore, Carter would think that Hannah thinks that Liam thinks that Emma thinks the tomato is in the blue_bottle, as Nathan claimed (statement 16).

So the answer is K. red_bottle
