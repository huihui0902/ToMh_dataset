 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts on solving this question:

1. Emma entered the study first but saw no tomato. She made no movements and exited after 1 minute. So she has no information about the tomato's location.

2. Hannah also made no movements and exited after 1 minute. So she also has no information.

3. The story tells us that initially the tomato was in the red_container. 

4. Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer. So he knows the tomato's current location is green_drawer.

5. Nathan made no movements and exited after 1 minute. So he has no information.

6. Carter made no movements and exited after 1 minute. So he also has no information.

7. When they entered the waiting_room, Nathan publicly claimed the tomato is in the blue_bottle. But based on Assumption 3 (every agent tend to lie), we should not trust this claim.

8. Carter privately told Emma that the tomato is in the green_drawer. Based on Assumption 2 (agents can only infer locations if they were in the same place), and given that Carter made no movements in the study, we should not trust this claim.

9. Based on Assumption 4 (agents tend to trust those who exited later), Liam who exited last from the study likely has the correct information.

10. The story tells us Liam moved the tomato to the green_drawer.

Therefore, the most likely location of the tomato is green_drawer, option B.

So my answer is B: red_drawer
