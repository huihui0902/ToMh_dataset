 Okay, here are my steps to solving the question:

1. Liam exited the study after Emma, Hannah and Nathan. According to assumption 4, Liam would tend to trust Emma's thought more than the other two.

2. According to assumption 2, Liam can only infer Emma's thought if they have private or public interactions. The story only mentions them being in the same place initially.

3. When Nathan publicly claimed the tomato is in the blue_bottle, Emma was still in the study and did not hear it. According to assumption 5, private claims cannot be overheard.

4. The only information Liam has about Emma's thought is that she was in the study initially and saw a cat, but did not move or speak.

5. Since Liam has no information about where Emma thinks the tomato is, the most logical answer would be that Liam thinks Emma thinks the tomato is in one of the places that has not been mentioned yet.

Therefore, the most likely answer is B: red_drawer. None of the other options are places that have not been mentioned yet.

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
