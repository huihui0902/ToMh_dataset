 Okay, here are my thoughts:

Based on the story and assumptions, we know:
- Emma saw the tomato in the red_container in the study (Story lines 3 and 4). 
- Emma did not witness any movements after she entered and before she exited the study (Story lines 5 and 6)
- Carter privately told Emma that the tomato was in the green_drawer after they entered the waiting_room (Story line 17)

So initially, Emma thought the tomato was in the red_container based on what she saw while in the study. Then after, Carter told her privately that it was in the green_drawer.

Assumption 4 states that "An agent tend to trust a agent that exited the room later than himself". And Carter exited the study after Emma (Story lines 5 and 14).

So based on all this, the most likely answer for where Emma thinks the tomato is would be:

G. green_drawer

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you need any clarification on my reasoning.
