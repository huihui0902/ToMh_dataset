 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts to solve this question:

1. Aiden made no movements and stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute. He witnessed everything before him exiting.

2. Nathan exited the master_bedroom after Aiden. So Aiden knows Nathan thinks the cabbage is in the red_box based on Statement 7.

3. William exited the master_bedroom last. So based on Assumption 4, Aiden thinks Nathan trusts William more.

4. From Statement 17, we know William privately told Isabella the cabbage is in the green_cupboard. But private communication cannot be overheard.

5. Therefore, Aiden thinks Nathan thinks William thinks the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

So the answer is E. green_cupboard
