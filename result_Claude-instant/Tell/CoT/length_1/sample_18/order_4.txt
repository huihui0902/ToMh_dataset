 Okay, here is my step by step reasoning:

1) William thinks the cabbage is in the green_cupboard according to what Isabella privately told him.  

2) Nathan exited before William, so he trusts William and thinks the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

3) Aiden exited before Nathan, so he trusts Nathan and thinks the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.  

4) Logan exited before Aiden, so he trusts Aiden and thinks Aiden thinks the cabbage is in the green_cupboard.

Therefore, the answer is: E) green_cupboard
