 Okay, here are my steps in determining where William thinks the cabbage is:

1. William entered the master_bedroom and lost his gloves there. He witnessed everything that happened before he exited.

2. Logan moved the cabbage from the red_bucket to the green_pantry. Nathan then moved it from the green_pantry to the red_box. 

3. William stayed in the master_bedroom for 1 minute after Nathan exited. So at this point, William thinks the cabbage is in the red_box based on what he witnessed.

4. William then exited the master_bedroom and entered the waiting_room with everyone else.

5. In the waiting_room, Isabella publicly claimed the cabbage is in the red_box. This confirms William's original thought that the cabbage is in the red_box.

6. However, William then privately told Isabella that the cabbage is in the green_cupboard. According to Assumption 3, William could be lying here. His actual thought may not change.

In summary, based on what William originally witnessed and the lack of sufficient evidence to change his mind, the most logical answer for where William thinks the cabbage actually is would be:

D. red_box
