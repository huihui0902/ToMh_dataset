 Okay, here is my step by step analysis of the situation:

1) According to assumption 1, agents witness everything before exiting a place. So when Logan exited the master_bedroom first, he saw Nathan move the cabbage to the red_box. 

2) Next, Nathan exited and also saw the cabbage being in the red_box.  

3) Then Isabella exited after staying 1 minute without doing anything. So she also saw the cabbage was in the red_box.

4) Aiden and William then exited after staying 1 minute without doing anything. So they also saw the cabbage was in the red_box.  

5) Then in the waiting_room, Isabella publicly claimed the cabbage is in the red_box. This is consistent with what she witnessed.

6) William then privately told Isabella the cabbage is in the green_cupboard. However, according to assumption 3, agents tend to lie, so this does not mean the cabbage actually is in the green_cupboard.

7) Based on the story and assumptions, the cabbage was last seen by all agents to be in the red_box. There are no contradictory claims.

So based on this analysis, my answer would be:

The cabbage is most likely in D. red_box
