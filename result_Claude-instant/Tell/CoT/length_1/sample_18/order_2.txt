 Okay, here are my steps for solving this problem:

1. Nathan exited the master_bedroom after Logan and before Isabella. So he witnessed Logan moving the cabbage to the green_pantry and Aiden losing his gloves.

2. William made no movements while in the master_bedroom and stayed the longest, so Nathan has no information about what William witnessed.  

3. Nathan witnessed Logan moving the cabbage to the green_pantry, so he knows the cabbage is in the green_pantry. 

4. Isabella publicly claimed the cabbage is in the red_box in the waiting_room, after Nathan exited the master_bedroom. 

5. William privately told Isabella the cabbage is in the green_cupboard in the waiting_room, after Nathan exited the master_bedroom.

6. Based on assumption 4, Nathan tends to trust agents that exited the room later than himself. So he will tend to trust Isabella and William over his own knowledge.

7. Therefore, Nathan will think that William thinks the cabbage is in the green_cupboard, as William privately told Isabella.

So the answer is E. green_cupboard.

Does that sound logical and cover all the relevant information? Let me know if you have any other questions.
