 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my reasoning:

1) Owen witnessed Elizabeth move the onion to the green_bucket (statement 11). 

2) When Owen exited the cellar, he had not witnessed anything else about the location of the onion (statement 13).

3) There were no private or public interactions between Owen and any of the other characters after Owen exited the cellar (statements 14 and 15).

4) Therefore, Owen last saw the onion being moved to the green_bucket and he has no reason to think it was moved from there.

So the answer is: E. green_bucket
