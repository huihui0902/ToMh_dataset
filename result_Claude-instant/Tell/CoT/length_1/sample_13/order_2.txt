 Based on the story and assumptions here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Elizabeth entered the cellar and witnessed Owen moving the onion to the red_crate. So she knows Owen actually put it in the red_crate.

2. Later, Elizabeth and Owen both exited the cellar. Neither of them interacted with others after that yet. 

3. Then in the waiting_room, Liam privately told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket. But this does not affect Elizabeth's knowledge.

4. Jack privately told Elizabeth that the onion is in the red_crate. But the fact that Jack told Elizabeth that does not mean Jack actually thinks it is in the red_crate. Elizabeth knows Jack tends to lie.

5. Based on Elizabeth's own knowledge from witnessing Owen's action in the cellar, she knows Owen actually put the onion in the red_crate.

Therefore, the answer should be:
A. red_crate
