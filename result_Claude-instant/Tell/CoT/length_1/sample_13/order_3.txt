 Here are my step-by-step thoughts:

1. Liam exited the cellar after Owen. Based on assumption 4, Liam will tend to trust Owen's actions more than others.

2. Owen moved the onion to the red_crate. So based on 1, Liam will think the onion is in the red_crate. 

3. Elizabeth moved to the onion to the green_bucket, but Liam did not witness this. Based on assumption 1, Liam only witnessed things before he exited.

4. Elizabeth and Owen did not have any private or public interactions. Based on assumption 2, Liam cannot infer Elizabeth's thoughts from this.

5. Liam privately told Noah the onion is in the green_bucket. But this does not affect Liam's actual thoughts. He still thinks the onion is in the red_crate based on trusting Owen.

6. Putting all this together, Liam thinks the onion is in the red_crate. And he has no information to infer where Elizabeth thinks Owen thinks the onion is.

So the answer is A: red_crate
