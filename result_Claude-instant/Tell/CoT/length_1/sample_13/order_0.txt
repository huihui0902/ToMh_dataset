 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step analysis:

1) When Noah exited the cellar, he did not see Elizabeth move the onion to the green_bucket. So Noah cannot know the actual location of the onion. 

2) When Jack exited the cellar, he also did not see Elizabeth move the onion. So Jack also cannot know the actual location.

3) When Liam exited the cellar, again he did not witness the onion being moved, so he also has no knowledge about its location.

4) When Elizabeth moved the onion to the green_bucket, she would know its actual location.

5) When Owen moved the onion to the red_crate, he would also know its actual location (assuming he actually moved it there).

6) After everyone exited the cellar, they entered the waiting_room.

7) In the waiting_room, Liam told Noah that the onion is in the green_bucket. Since Liam did not actually witness this, we can assume he is lying based on Assumption 3.

8) Jack told Elizabeth that the onion is in the red_crate. Again, since Jack did not witness the onion's movement, we can assume this is a lie based on Assumption 3.

9) Therefore, based on the information provided and the assumptions, the onion is most likely actually in the green_bucket, as Elizabeth moved it there and Owen's reported location cannot be trusted.

So the most likely answer is: E. green_bucket
