 Based on the story and assumptions, my reasoning is:

1. Abigail, Lily and Ella all stayed in the den for 1 minute and witnessed no movements. So they have no information about the location of the green_pepper (assumption 1).

2. The story states that "The green_pepper is in the red_drawer" initially (line 2).

3. Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate (line 9). 

4. After Logan exited, Elizabeth stayed in the den for 1 minute but witnessed no movements (line 11). So she also has no information about the location of the green_pepper (assumption 1).

5. Ella publicly claimed that the green_pepper is in the red_pantry (line 14). But according to assumption 3, her public claim does not affect her actual knowledge, so we should not consider her claim.

6. Elizabeth privately told Ella that the green_pepper is in the red_drawer (line 15). But according to assumption 2, this private interaction does not give Ella information, since they were not in the same place.

Therefore, based on the actual movements witnessed in the story, the green_pepper should be in:

D. blue_crate
