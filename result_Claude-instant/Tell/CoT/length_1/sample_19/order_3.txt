 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Logan moved the green_pepper to the blue_crate. So Logan knows the green_pepper is in the blue_crate.

2. Lily exited before Logan, so Lily does not know where Logan moved the green_pepper. Lily only knows what she witnessed before exiting, which is that the green_pepper was in the red_drawer.

3. Therefore, Lily thinks the green_pepper is in the red_drawer.

4. Ella exited after Lily but before Logan. So Ella does not know where Logan moved the green_pepper, but she knows Lily thinks it is in the red_drawer.

5. Therefore, Ella thinks Lily thinks the green_pepper is in the red_drawer.

6. Putting this all together, the answer is that:

Ella thinks Lily thinks Logan thinks the green_pepper is in the red_drawer.

The answer is B: red_drawer
