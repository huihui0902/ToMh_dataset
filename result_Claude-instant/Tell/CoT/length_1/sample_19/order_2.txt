 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Lily exited the den after Abigail and before Ella. So she witnessed Abigail make no movements and Ella make no movements.

2. The story states the green_pepper was originally in the red_drawer. 

3. Lily witnessed Logan move the green_pepper to the blue_crate before he exited.

4. Lily then witnessed Elizabeth make no movements before they all entered the waiting_room.

5. In the waiting_room, Ella publicly claimed the green_pepper was in the red_pantry. But Lily knows from witnessing Logan that it is actually in the blue_crate.

6. Then Elizabeth privately told Ella the green_pepper is in the red_drawer. But again, Lily knows from witnessing Logan that it is actually in the blue_crate.

7. So based on Lily's actual knowledge from witnessing Logan's movements, the green_pepper is in the blue_crate.

8. The question is where Lily thinks *Logan thinks* the green_pepper is. Since Lily witnessed Logan move the pepper to the blue_crate, she knows that Logan thinks it is in the blue_crate.

Therefore, the answer is D: blue_crate
