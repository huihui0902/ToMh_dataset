 Okay, here are my steps to solving this question:

1. Logan moved the green pepper to the blue_crate in line 9, so he knows its actual location.

2. According to assumption 1, an agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. So when Logan exited the den in line 10, he knows the green pepper is in the blue_crate. 

3. According to assumption 3, what a character tells others doesn't affect his actual thought. So Ella claiming it's in the red_pantry in line 14 does not change Logan's belief that it is in the blue_crate.

4. According to assumption 2, Logan cannot infer other agents' thoughts unless they were in the same place or had private/public interactions. Logan had no interactions with any agents after he exited the den.

5. Therefore, Logan still thinks the green pepper is in the blue_crate, so the answer is D: blue_crate.

In summary, Logan moved the green pepper to the blue_crate, witnessed this before exiting, had no interactions that could change his belief after exiting, so he still thinks it is in the blue_crate.
