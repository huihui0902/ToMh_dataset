 Okay, here are my steps in determining where the pear is located:

1. We are first told that the pear started in the blue_crate.

2. Ava then moved the pear to the green_envelope and exited the lounge.  

3. Avery then moved the pear to the red_pantry and exited the lounge.

4. Isabella, Mila and Sophia then entered and exited the lounge without making any movements.

5. In the waiting room, Isabella publicly claimed the pear is in the green_envelope. However, since agents tend to lie, this claim cannot be trusted.

6. Sophia then privately told Isabella that the pear is in the blue_crate. However, since Sophia and Isabella were not previously in the same place, Isabella cannot actually infer Sophia's true thoughts based on the assumptions.

7. The last definitive location we know the pear was moved to was the red_pantry by Avery.

Based on these steps, the answer is likely H. red_pantry where Avery last moved the pear.

In summary, the key points are:
1) The pear started in the blue_crate
2) Ava moved it to the green_envelope 
3) Avery then moved it to the red_pantry, which is the last known location.
4) The claims made later cannot be trusted due to the assumptions.

Does this logic look good for determining where the pear actually is? Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
