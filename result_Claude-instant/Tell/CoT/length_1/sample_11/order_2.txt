 Okay, here are my steps to solve this problem:

1. Ava exited the lounge before Sophia, so according to assumption 4, Ava will tend not to trust Sophia's thoughts.

2. When Ava was in the lounge, the pear was first in the blue_crate and then in the green_envelope. Ava did not witness anything after she exited.

3. When Sophia was in the lounge, the pear was last seen in the green_envelope by Ava. 

4. In the waiting room, Isabella claimed the pear is in the green_envelope. According to assumption 2, Sophia heard this claim.

5. However, according to assumption 3, Sophia's actual thoughts are not affected by what others say. She will tend to assume the pear is where she last saw it, which was in the green_envelope.

6. Putting it all together, Ava will think Sophia thinks the pear is in the green_envelope, based on her limited knowledge and assumptions 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Therefore, the answer is I. green_envelope
