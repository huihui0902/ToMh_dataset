 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Liam thinks the peach is in the blue_treasure_chest. He tells Avery this privately in the waiting_room.

2. Avery only has Liam's private statement to go on. So initially, Avery thinks the peach is in the blue_treasure_chest based on Liam's claim.  

3. However, the assumptions state that agents tend to lie. So Avery may doubt that Liam's claim is actually true.

4. Avery has no other clues or information about the peach's location. Avery did not witness any movements in the patio. And Avery did not have any interactions with other agents besides Liam's private statement.

5. Therefore, based on the given information, the most likely answer for where Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is located would be:

O. blue_treasure_chest 

Which is what Liam privately told Avery. The other locations have no evidence to support them.

Does this logically follow from the story and assumptions? Let me know if you have any other questions!
