 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Hannah, Liam, Benjamin, Avery and Mila entered the patio. Nothing relevant here.

2) Liam lost his gloves. Also not relevant.

3) The peach is in the red_basket. Again, not relevant.

4-13) Everyone stayed in the patio for 1 minute then exited. They witnessed everything that happened before they exited. 

14) Everyone entered the waiting_room. 

15) Liam lost his gloves again. Not relevant.

16) Benjamin privately told Hannah that the peach is in the red_envelope. Since this was a private communication, Avery and Liam did not hear this.

17) Liam privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle. 

Given the assumptions:

Avery heard from Liam that the peach is in the red_bottle.

Benjamin did not hear anything about where Liam thinks the peach is. He only privately told Hannah his own thought.

So based on the information available, Benjamin cannot infer where Liam thinks Avery thinks the peach is. He has no information on that.

Therefore, the answer is B: blue_drawer
