 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. According to the story, the peach was initially in the red_basket (statement 3).

2. Hannah was the first person to exit the patio, after staying for 1 minute without moving (statements 4 and 5). So she witnessed the peach being in the red_basket. 

3. Liam moved the peach to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting the patio (statements 6 and 7). 

4. Benjamin and Avery then exited the patio after 1 minute without moving (statements 8-11). So they did not witness the peach being moved.

5. Mila was the last to exit the patio, after 1 minute without moving (statements 12 and 13). So she also did not witness the peach being moved.

6. In the waiting_room, Liam and Benjamin made conflicting claims about the peach's location to Avery and Hannah (statements 15-17). But according to assumption 3, we cannot trust what the characters say.

7. Based on assumption 4, Hannah would tend to trust Liam more, since he exited the patio later.

8. Therefore, based on Hannah witnessing Liam move the peach to the blue_treasure_chest, and tending to trust Liam more, the peach is most likely in the blue_treasure_chest (Option O).

In summary, the peach is likely in the blue_treasure_chest (Option O).
