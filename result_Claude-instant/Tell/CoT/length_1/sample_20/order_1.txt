 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my step by step analysis of where Avery thinks the peach is:

1. Avery entered the patio with everyone else and stayed there for 1 minute. During that time, Liam lost his gloves and the peach was in the red_basket. 

2. Avery then exited the patio. According to Assumption 1, Avery witnessed everything that happened before he exited.

3. Avery then entered the waiting_room with everyone else. Liam again lost his gloves and Benjamin told Hannah the peach is in the red_envelope.

4. Importantly, Liam privately told Avery that the peach is in the red_bottle. Since this was a private communication, Avery can infer Liam's thought according to Assumption 2.

5. Since Avery exited the waiting_room last, according to Assumption 4 he will tend to trust Liam's claim the most.

Putting this all together, the answer is that Avery thinks the peach is in:

N. red_bottle
