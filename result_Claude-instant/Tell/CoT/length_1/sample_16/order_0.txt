 Okay, here are my steps for solving the multiple choice question:

1. Evelyn moved the tomato to the red_crate according to line 11. So initially, the tomato was in the red_crate.

2. According to assumption 1, each agent witnesses everything before exiting a place. Since all agents exited the closet, they all know the tomato was last moved to the red_crate by Evelyn. 

3. According to assumption 3, what an agent tells others doesn't affect their actual thought. So Carter telling Aiden the tomato is in the green_box in line 14 is a lie, and Isla telling Jack the tomato is in the green_basket in line 15 is also a lie.

4. Based on the above points, the tomato's true location is the red_crate, where Evelyn last moved it before exiting the closet.

So the answer should be: L. red_crate

Please let me know if my step-by-step logic looks reasonable and if you would like me to elaborate more on any part. I tried to carefully follow the assumptions and information provided in the story.
