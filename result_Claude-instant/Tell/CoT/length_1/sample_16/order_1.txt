 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Jack entered the closet and witnessed everyone's actions before exiting.

2) He saw Evelyn move the tomato to the red_crate.

3) After exiting, Isla privately told Jack that the tomato is in the green_basket. 

Based on Assumption 2, Jack can infer Isla's thoughts from this private communication.

4) According to Assumption 4, Jack tends to trust agents that exited later than him. In this case, that was only Isla.

5) Therefore, Jack will likely actually think the tomato is in the green_basket based on what Isla told him.

So my final answer is:

A. red_basket
B. green_pantry  
C. blue_suitcase
D. green_bucket 
E. red_envelope
F. green_drawer
G. green_bathtub      
H. green_cupboard
I. blue_treasure_chest   
J. red_drawer
K. blue_bottle  
L. red_crate  
M. green_box
N. blue_container
O. green_basket

Let me know if my reasoning makes sense and if you would like me to explain anything in more detail.
