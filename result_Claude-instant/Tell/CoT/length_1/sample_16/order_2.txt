 Okay, here is my step by step analysis:

1) Isla exited the closet before Carter and Jack did. Based on Assumption 4, she will tend to trust them more than herself.

2) After exiting the closet, Isla was not told anything by Carter or Jack publicly. So based on Assumption 5, she has no information from them. 

3) The only information Isla has is what Evelyn told her privately in line 15: "the tomato is in the green_basket". 

4) Based on Assumption 3, Isla cannot assume that what others tell her is true. She will maintain her own thoughts.

5) Therefore, Isla's own thought is that the tomato is in the green_basket, based only on what Evelyn privately told her.

6) The question asks where Isla thinks Jack thinks the tomato is. Since Isla has no information about Jack's thoughts, other than what Evelyn told her, the answer should be:

O. green_basket

So the answer is O: green_basket

Does this analysis and final answer make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions.
