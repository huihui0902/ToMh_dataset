 Okay, here is my step by step thought process:

1. Carter exited the closet after Isla. Based on Assumption 4, Carter will tend to trust Isla more than himself.

2. Isla exited the closet after Jack. So Isla will tend to trust Jack's claim over her own thoughts. 

3. Isla privately told Jack that the tomato is in the green_basket (Statement 15).

4. Based on Assumptions 1 and 2, Carter was not present when Isla told Jack the location. So Carter has no information about what Isla thinks Jack thinks.

5. Since Carter has no information about what Isla thinks Jack thinks, the most reasonable answer is that Carter thinks Isla thinks Jack thinks the tomato is in one of the locations Carter has no information about.

Therefore, the answer is B. green_pantry
