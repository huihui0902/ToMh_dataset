 Step by step reasoning:

1) Aiden stayed in the closet for 1 minute and exited. So he witnessed everyone else's moves before exiting.

2) Isla stayed in the closet for 1 minute and exited after Aiden. So Aiden witnessed Isla's move. 

3) Carter moved the tomato to the blue_container and exited after Isla. So Aiden witnessed Carter's move.

4) Jack moved the tomato to the green_box and exited after Carter. So Aiden witnessed Jack's move.

5) Evelyn moved the tomato back to the red_crate and exited last. So Aiden witnessed Evelyn's move.

6) In the waiting room, Carter privately told Aiden that the tomato is in the green_box.

7) Isla privately told Jack that the tomato is in the green_basket. But Aiden did not witness this interaction.

Based on the above, Aiden witnessed that:

- Jack moved the tomato to the green_box 
- Carter told Aiden that the tomato is in the green_box

So the answer is:

Where Aiden thinks Carter thinks Isla thinks Jack thinks the tomato is:

M. green_box
