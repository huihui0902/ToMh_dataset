 Here is my step-by-step analysis based on the story and assumptions:

1) Abigail entered the laundry and then exited without moving the spinach. So she does not know where the spinach is.

2) Owen then moved the spinach to the red_basket and exited. So Owen knows the spinach is in the red_basket.

3) Amelia then exited without moving the spinach. So she does not know where the spinach is.  

4) Jack then moved the spinach to the green_pantry and exited. So Jack knows the spinach is in the green_pantry.

5) Aiden then moved the spinach to the blue_suitcase and exited. So Aiden knows the spinach is in the blue_suitcase.

6) Then all five characters entered the waiting_room. 

7) Amelia publicly claimed the spinach is in the red_container. But we are told to assume characters tend to lie, so this does not reflect Amelia's actual thought.

8) Aiden privately told Amelia the spinach is in the blue_suitcase. This reveals Aiden's actual thought.

9) Based on Assumption 4, Jack will tend to trust Aiden more since Aiden exited the laundry later.

So the final answer is:

Jack thinks Aiden thinks the spinach is in the F. blue_suitcase
