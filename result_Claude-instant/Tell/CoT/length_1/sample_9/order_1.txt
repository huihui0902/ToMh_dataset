 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Abigail entered the laundry where the spinach was initially in the blue_suitcase.

2. Abigail stayed in the laundry for 1 minute and then exited. She witnessed everything that happened before she exited.

3. Owen then moved the spinach to the red_basket and exited the laundry.  

4. Amelia then stayed in the laundry for 1 minute and exited. She witnessed Owen move the spinach to the red_basket.

5. Jack then moved the spinach to the green_pantry and exited the laundry. 

6. Aiden then moved the spinach to the blue_suitcase and exited the laundry.

7. Based on Assumption 1, when Abigail exited the laundry she saw that the spinach was in the red_basket.

8. Later, Abigail, Owen, Amelia, Jack and Aiden all entered the waiting_room.

9. Amelia publicly claimed the spinach was in the red_container. But based on Assumption 3, the agents tend to lie so this claim does not reflect Amelia's true thoughts.

10. Aiden privately told Amelia the spinach was in the blue_suitcase. But based on Assumption 2, Amelia cannot infer Aiden's thought since they did not interact in the laundry.

11. In summary, when Abigail exited the laundry she saw the spinach was in the red_basket. There is no information to suggest her thought has changed.

Therefore, the most likely answer is: G. red_basket
