 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Owen exited the laundry after Abigail, so according to assumption 4, he tends to trust Abigail more.

2. When Abigail was in the laundry, according to the story, she made no movements and stayed for 1 minute. 

3. According to assumption 1, Owen would have witnessed that Abigail did not move the spinach from the blue suitcase.

4. After Abigail and Owen exited the laundry, the spinach's location was changed. But Abigail had no knowledge of this.

5. When everyone entered the waiting room, Amelia publicly claimed the spinach was in the red container. 

6. Aiden then privately told Amelia that the spinach was actually in the blue suitcase.

7. According to assumption 2, this private interaction between Aiden and Amelia would not affect Abigail's thought.

8. Combining all this, when Owen exited the laundry, he would trust that Abigail still thinks the spinach is in the blue suitcase, where it was originally.

Therefore, the answer is F: blue_suitcase
