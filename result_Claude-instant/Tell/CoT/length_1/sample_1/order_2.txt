 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Hannah entered the hall after everyone else and exited last.

2. According to assumption 4, Hannah will tend to trust Charlotte and Noah's claims the most, since they exited after her. 

3. According to assumption 2, Hannah can infer Noah and Charlotte's thoughts because they were all in the hall together. 

4. Hannah witnessed Noah move the carrot to the green_envelope. Based on assumption 1, she knows this is where Noah thinks the carrot is.

5. Hannah then moved the carrot to the red_basket. However, according to assumption 3, this does not necessarily reflect her actual thoughts on the carrot's location.

6. Charlotte then publicly claimed the carrot is in the green_envelope. Based on assumptions 1 and 5, Hannah heard this claim.

7. Finally, Hannah privately told Charlotte the carrot is in the blue_container. However, according to assumption 2, William would not have learned this since he was not privy to their private conversation.

Putting this all together, Hannah would think that William thinks the carrot is in the green_envelope, based on Charlotte's public claim that was heard by everyone in the hall, including William.

So my final answer is: A. green_envelope
