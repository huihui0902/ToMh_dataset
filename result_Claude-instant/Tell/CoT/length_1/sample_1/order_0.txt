 OK, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Based on assumption 1, Noah witnessed the carrot being placed in the red_basket before he exited the hall.

2. Hannah placed the carrot in the red_basket before she exited the hall, so she knows the carrot's real location.  

3. Charlotte publicly claimed the carrot is in the green_envelope after everyone entered the waiting_room. But based on assumption 3, characters tend to lie, so this claim is likely false.

4. Hannah then privately told Charlotte the carrot is in the blue_container. But again based on assumption 3, characters tend to lie.

5. Based on assumption 4, Charlotte would tend to trust Hannah more since Hannah exited the hall later. But we already established that Hannah knows the real location is the red_basket.

Therefore, based on these steps in reasoning, my answer is B: red_basket. The carrot's real location is in the red_basket.

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any questions or need me to clarify or expand on any part of my reasoning.
