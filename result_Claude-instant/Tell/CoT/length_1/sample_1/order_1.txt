 Based on the story and assumptions, here is my logical step-by-step analysis of where William thinks the carrot is:

1. William entered the hall and saw Noah, Jack, Charlotte and Hannah.

2. William witnessed Noah move the carrot to the green_envelope. Noah then exited the hall.

3. According to Assumption 1, William witnessed everything before he exited the hall.

4. William then exited the hall and entered the waiting_room with the others.  

5. In the waiting_room, Charlotte publicly claimed the carrot is in the green_envelope.

6. However, according to Assumption 3, agents tend to lie. So Charlotte's public claim does not affect William's actual thought.

7. Hannah then privately told Charlotte the carrot is in the blue_container. But according to Assumption 5, private communication cannot be overheard. So William did not hear this.

8. Therefore, based on what William actually witnessed, he thinks the carrot is in the green_envelope where Noah moved it.

In conclusion, based on the story and assumptions, the answer is likely to be:

A. green_envelope
