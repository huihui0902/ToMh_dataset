 Here is my step by step analysis to find the answer:

1. Alexander thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_suitcase. This is because he moved it there before exiting the den (according to Assumption 1).

2. Evelyn thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_treasure_chest. This is because she moved it there before exiting the den. 

3. Hannah and Abigail made no movements and only stayed in the den, so they have no information about the green_pepper's location from being in the den.

4. Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green_pepper is in the green_envelope. However, according to Assumption 3, we know characters tend to lie, so this does not necessarily reflect Evelyn's actual thought.

5. When Abraham, Evelyn, Hannah and Noah entered the waiting_room, no information was shared about the green_pepper.

6. Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate. However, according to Assumption 3, this is a lie and does not reflect Hannah's actual thought.

7. Based on the information provided and Assumptions 1 through 5, Abigail only knows that Evelyn thinks the green_pepper is in the blue_treasure_chest.

Therefore, the answer is: Abigail thinks Hannah thinks Evelyn thinks Alexander thinks the green_pepper is in J. blue_treasure_chest.
