 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. According to assumption 1, Alexander witnessed everything before exiting the den, including Evelyn moving the pepper to the treasure chest. 

2. After Alexander exited, Evelyn, Hannah and Abigail entered and exited the den. But according to assumption 2, they cannot infer Alexander's thoughts unless they interacted with him.

3. The only interaction mentioned is Hannah privately telling Alexander the pepper is in the blue crate. But according to assumption 3, characters tend to lie, so this does not reflect Alexander's actual thoughts.

4. Since no other interactions with Alexander are mentioned, he has no information aside from what he witnessed himself before exiting the den.

5. According to the story, when Alexander exited the den, the last place he saw the pepper was in the blue suitcase where he put it.

Therefore, the answer is likely I. blue_suitcase based on retracing Alexander's knowledge and assuming characters tend to lie when speaking.

Does this logic make sense? Let me know if you have any other questions!
