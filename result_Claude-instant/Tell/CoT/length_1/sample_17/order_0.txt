 Based on the story and assumptions, here are my thoughts:

1) Alexander saw the green_pepper in the blue_crate when he first entered the den (line 2).

2) Alexander moved the green_pepper to the blue_suitcase before exiting the den (line 3). 

3) Evelyn saw the green_pepper in the blue_suitcase when she entered the den, since Alexander had already exited (lines 4 and 5).  

4) Evelyn moved the green_pepper to the blue_treasure_chest before exiting the den (line 5).

5) Hannah made no movements and did not see where the green_pepper was, since Alexander and Evelyn had already exited (lines 7 and 8).

6) Abigail also made no movements and did not see where the green_pepper was (lines 9 and 10).

7) Noah also made no movements and did not see where the green_pepper was (lines 11 and 12).

8) The private communication between Evelyn and Abigail (line 16) cannot be trusted, since agents tend to lie (assumption 3).

9) The private communication between Hannah and Alexander (line 15) also cannot be trusted.

Based on the above, the green_pepper is most likely in the:

J. blue_treasure_chest

Since that is the last place we know for certain the green_pepper was moved to, before Evelyn exited the den (line 5).
