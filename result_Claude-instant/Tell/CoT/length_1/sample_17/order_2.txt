 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1) According to Assumption 1, when Alexander exited the den in Line 4, he witnessed that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate (Line 2). 

2) When Evelyn exited the den in Line 6, she witnessed that the green_pepper is in the blue_suitcase, as Alexander moved it there in Line 3.

3) When Hannah and Abigail exited the den in Lines 8 and 10 respectively, they witnessed nothing as they made no movements.

4) In Line 15, Hannah privately told Alexander that the green_pepper is in the blue_crate. However, according to Assumption 3, that doesn't necessarily reflect her actual thought.

5) In Line 16, Evelyn privately told Abigail that the green_pepper is in the green_envelope. Again, according to Assumption 3, that may not reflect Evelyn's actual thought.

6) When all agents entered the waiting_room in Line 13, no one shared any information that could reveal where they actually think the green_pepper is located.

Given the above, there is no information that suggests Evelyn thinks Alexander thinks the green_pepper is in any of the listed locations. The answer is therefore None of the above.
