 Alright, here is my step by step thought process to solve the question:

1) Carter told Ava privately that the tangerine is in the red_basket. So Carter thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.

2) Ava witnessed everything before she exited the cellar. So Ava knows that Carter moved the tangerine to the red_basket. 

3) Amelia made no movements and stayed in the cellar for 1 minute after Ava exited. So Ava has no information about what Amelia thinks.

4) According to assumption 2, Ava can only infer another agent's thought if they have been in the same place or had private/public interactions. Ava and Amelia had neither.

5) Therefore, Ava has no information to conclude where Amelia thinks the tangerine is. The most rational assumption is that Ava thinks Amelia has no idea where the tangerine is.

In summary, Carter thinks Ava thinks Amelia thinks the tangerine is: nowhere (i.e. has no idea where it is).

So the answer should be B. green_drawer, as that is the only option that indicates Amelia has no knowledge of the tangerine's location.
