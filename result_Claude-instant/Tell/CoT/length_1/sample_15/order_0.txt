 Okay, here are my thoughts step by step:

1) The story says the tangerine starts in the red_basket.

2) Ava exits without moving it, so she thinks it's still in the red_basket.

3) Sophia moves it to the green_bottle before exiting. So Sophia thinks it's in the green_bottle now. 

4) Amelia exits without moving it, so she still thinks it's in the red_basket.

5) Abigail moves it to the red_crate before exiting. So Abigail thinks it's in the red_crate now.

6) Carter moves it back to the red_basket before exiting. So Carter thinks it's in the red_basket now.

7) When they enter the waiting_room, Abigail claims it's in the green_bottle. But we know she actually put it in the red_crate, so she is lying.

8) Carter tells Ava privately that it's in the red_basket. And since Carter last moved and exited the cellar, Ava has reason to trust that Carter knows the correct location.

Based on these steps, the most likely answer is:

L. red_basket

Since Carter last moved and exited the cellar, claiming he put it in the red_basket, and Ava has no reason to distrust Carter based on the assumptions given.
