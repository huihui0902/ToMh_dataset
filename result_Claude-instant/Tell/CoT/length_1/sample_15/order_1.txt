 Here are my step by step thoughts:

1) Amelia entered the cellar and saw the tangerine in the red_basket (from line 2)

2) Amelia stayed in the cellar for 1 minute then exited (lines 7 and 8). During that time, she did not witness any movements so she still thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket.

3) After Amelia exited the cellar, Abigail moved the tangerine to the red_crate (line 9). But Amelia did not witness this so she is still unaware of the change.  

4) Amelia did not have any private or public interactions with the other agents after she exited the cellar (lines 13 and 14 only mention they went to the waiting room, without any interactions).

5) Given assumptions 1, 2 and 3, Amelia still thinks the tangerine is where she last saw it, which was in the red_basket.  

Therefore, the answer should be L: red_basket.
