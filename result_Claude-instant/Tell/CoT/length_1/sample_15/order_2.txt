 Okay, here are the step by step considerations:

1. Ava entered the cellar after Amelia and exited before Amelia. So Ava witnessed Amelia making no movements and staying in the cellar for 1 minute.

2. After exiting the cellar, Ava and Amelia went to the waiting room. 

3. In the waiting room, Abigail publicly claimed that the tangerine is in the green_bottle. This means Ava heard this claim.

4. Carter privately told Ava that the tangerine is in the red_basket.

5. Based on assumption 1, Ava would have inferred that Amelia made no movements and saw nothing while in the cellar. 

6. Based on assumption 2, Ava cannot infer Amelia's thoughts from the public claim in the waiting room since they were not in the same place when that claim was made.

7. Based on assumption 3, the claims made by others do not reflect their actual thoughts.

8. Based on assumption 4, Ava would tend to trust Carter who exited the cellar later than her.

So put together, Ava would think that Amelia thinks the tangerine is in the red_basket, based on what Carter privately told Ava.

The answer is: L. red_basket
