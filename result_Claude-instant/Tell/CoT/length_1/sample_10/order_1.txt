 Okay, here are my step by step thoughts:

1. Carter entered the study first and stayed there for 1 minute without moving. Based on assumption 1, he witnessed the potato being placed in the blue_bathtub.

2. Carter then exited the study and did not return. He did not have any interactions with the other agents.

3. Based on assumption 4, Carter tends to trust an agent that exited later than him. In this case, that would be Alexander.

4. Alexander made no movements for 1 minute in the study and then exited. He did not change the location of the potato.

5. In the waiting room, Jacob publicly claimed the potato is in the blue_bathtub. However, according to assumption 3, this does not necessarily reflect his actual thought. 

6. Alexander then privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle.

7. Since Carter was not present for either the public claim or private communication between Jacob and Alexander, based on assumption 2 he cannot infer their thoughts.

8. Therefore, based on what Carter witnessed himself when he first entered the study, the answer is:

Carter really thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub.

The answer is A: blue_bathtub
