 Okay, here are my steps to solving this problem:

1. Initially, the potato is in the blue_bathtub according to line 2.

2. Carter exited the study without making any movements, so he did not move the potato (line 3 and 4).

3. Avery moved the potato to the blue_pantry before exiting the study (line 5 and 6).

4. Jacob moved the potato to the green_cupboard before exiting the study (line 7 and 8).

5. Jackson made no movements and did not move the potato (line 9 and 10).

6. Similarly, Alexander did not move the potato (line 11 and 12).

7. When they entered the waiting_room, Jacob publicly claimed the potato is in the blue_bathtub (line 14). However, we know from step 4 that Jacob actually moved the potato to the green_cupboard.

8. Alexander privately told Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle (line 15). However, since Alexander did not actually move the potato or see who did, we cannot trust this claim.

Given all this, the potato is most likely actually in the green_cupboard, so the answer is B: green_cupboard.
