 Okay, here are the step by step thoughts:

1) Jackson witnessed nothing while he was in the study, so he has no direct information about where the potato is.

2) Jackson heard Jacob publicly claim that the potato is in the blue_bathtub. Since public claims can be heard by anyone in the waiting_room, Jackson heard this claim.

3) Jackson then heard Alexander privately tell Jacob that the potato is in the blue_bottle. Since this was a private communication, Jackson did not hear this.

4) Based on the available information, Jackson thinks:
- Jacob thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub, since that is what Jacob publicly claimed. 
- Carter thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub, since that is what Jacob (who exited after Carter) claimed.

5) Since Jackson did not hear Alexander's private comment to Jacob, Jackson does not update his belief about what Alexander thinks.

6) Therefore, Jackson thinks Alexander thinks Jacob thinks Carter thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub.

The answer is A: blue_bathtub
