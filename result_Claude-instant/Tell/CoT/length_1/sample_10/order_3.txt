 Okay, here are my step-by-step thoughts:

1) From line 2, we know the potato starts in the blue_bathtub.

2) Carter exited the study in line 4 without moving the potato, so he still thinks it's in the blue_bathtub.

3) Avery moved the potato to the blue_pantry in line 5, so he thinks it's there now. 

4) Jacob moved the potato to the green_cupboard in line 7, so he thinks it's there.

5) Jackson exited without moving the potato, so he still thinks it's in the blue_bathtub.

6) Alexander exited without moving the potato, so he also thinks it's in the blue_bathtub.

7) In line 14, Jacob publicly claims the potato is in the blue_bathtub. This is a lie to mislead the others.

8) In line 15, Alexander privately tells Jacob the potato is actually in the blue_bottle.

9) Now we get to the question: Where does Alexander think Jacob thinks Carter thinks the potato is?

Based on the assumptions:

- Alexander thinks Jacob thinks the potato is in the blue_bathtub, since that's what Jacob publicly claimed (assumption 2).  
- Alexander doesn't know Carter exited before Jacob, so he doesn't realize Carter doesn't know about Jacob's lie.
- Therefore, Alexander thinks Jacob thinks Carter still thinks the potato is in its original location, the blue_bathtub.

So the answer is A: blue_bathtub
