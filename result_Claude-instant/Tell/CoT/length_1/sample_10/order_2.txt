 Okay, here are the steps to solve this question:

1. Carter enters the study and exits after 1 minute without making any movements. So he has no information to infer where the potato is.

2. Avery moves the potato to the blue_pantry and exits.  

3. Jacob moves the potato to the green_cupboard and exits.

4. Jackson enters, exits without any movements. So he has no information.

5. Alexander enters, exits without any movements. He also has no information.

6. In the waiting room, Jacob publicly claims the potato is in the blue_bathtub. However, we are told agents tend to lie, so this is likely not true.

7. Alexander privately tells Jacob the potato is in the blue_bottle. 

Since Jacob and Alexander were in the study together, Jacob can infer Alexander's thought based on this private communication.

Therefore, the answer is C: blue_bottle
