 Okay, here are my steps to solving this question:

1. Lily stayed in the hallway for 1 minute after everyone else exited. So she witnessed no one moving the onion according to Assumption 1.

2. According to the story, the onion was originally in the green_crate. 

3. Lily had no private or public interactions with anyone in the hallway according to the story.

4. Based on Assumptions 2, 3 and the previous points, Lily has no information to think that the onion is anywhere other than the green_crate, where it was originally.

5. Avery exited the hallway before Lily, so according to Assumption 4, Avery will trust that Lily thinks the onion is still in the green_crate.

So the answer is A: green_crate

The key steps here were:

- Figuring out that Lily witnessed no movements based on Assumption 1 
- Realizing Lily had no information from others based on Assumptions 2 and 3
- Applying Assumption 4 that Avery will trust Lily thinks the onion is where it was originally based on Avery exiting before Lily.
