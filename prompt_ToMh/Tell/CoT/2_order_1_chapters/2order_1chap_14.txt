Note: You should assume the following. (1) A character A can infer another character B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have privately communicated, or have heard of the same public announcement. (2) A character would decide whether to trust others' words based on the order of characters exiting the room. Especially, Character A must believe any information given by B if B exited the room later than A. (3) Agents in private communications know that others won't hear them, but anyone can hear any public claims.
