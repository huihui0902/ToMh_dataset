(1) A character A can infer another character B's mental state only if A and B have been in the same location, or have privately communicated, or have heard of the same public announcement. (2) A character would decide whether to trust others' words based on the order of characters exiting the room. Especially, Character A must believe any information given by B if B exited the room later than A.
